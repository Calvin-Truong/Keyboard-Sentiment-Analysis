PICTEK RGB Gaming Keyboard USB Wired Keyboard, Crater Architecture Backlit Computer Keyboard with 8 Independent Multimedia Keys, 25 Keys Anti-ghosting, Splash-Proof, Ideal for PC/Mac Game, Black






",$21.99 ,PICTEK,Gaming,KisnardOnline,Love the keypress sound,"Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2019","
   I love typing on this keyboard.  It is so comfortable on my fingers and wrists.  The spacebar has an awesome bevel to it, the keys pop off of my fingers with the perfect little noise.  Very quiet, but yet they pop back up nicely.  Listen to the video I attached and you can hear for yourself.  They have a very quiet sound and feeling to them.The coating on the keys is very soft, but not sticky on your fingers.  It is like a soft plastic-felt like feeling - hard to describe.  The keys are spaced nicely and seem to be standard because my fingers were positioned perfectly right from the getgo.  Some keyboards feel shifted to me and this did not.  I like the curve on the left side because I rest my pinky on it - I don't use all of my left fingers to type - Mavis Beacon would be disappointed.It has a nice short row of extra buttons on top for media control and volume level which are just perfect for my laptop.  The lights are awesome and add a nice little glow and fun for my kids.  Full size number keypad is also a must.Some background on me - I am an IT professional by day and video game programmer by night and can type ~74 works a minute.  So far I have used this for a week+ and love it.  Do not have a single complaint about this keyboard.  Do yourself a favor and buy one.

",$21.99 ,PICTEK,Gaming,leo,seems good so far.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2019","
   I ordered this keyboard with low expectations, it is on the cheaper end of the price spectrum for RGB keyboards but it performs very well. The packaging was nothing special. But the colors are very vibrant and pretty bright. There are only a few modes. 1 fade (fades between colors) 2 (waves/jump  the keyboard is completely lit up with all the colors and they jump across the keyboard) 3 manual set; You tap the button to get to the color you want. (this also works for the multi color mode) and finally the breath function where it fades in and out with one color. The effects aren't that cool. But the actual keys on the keyboard feel very good. It is snappy and they are semi hard to press which I like overall it feels like the keyboard is overall quality. Although I have not have the keyboard for very long. I will update my review if it breaks soon. You can see in my photos a picture in a normal light, dark and a video of the modes.

  Update:Pictek got in contact with me and offered to replace the keyboard free of charge and shipped the new one out promptly. I wanted to use the new one for a while before updating my review, to be sure no new issues cropped up, but so far so good. The space bar key is a little bit ""mushier"" than the others in terms of feel, but it works well, no issues with sticky keys or randomly-inserted spaces or letters. Updated my review from two stars to five based on customer service and new keyboard working as intended.Old review:I haven't had the issues  other people have mentioned about the  LEDs  not retaining their  preset, but I have had  problems with the  space bar. Mainly  to  the tune of it either refusing to put a space between  words even when  pressed sharply enough  to startle the  cat, or it inserting  extra spaces  with the lightest possible tap. It's pretty  comfortable to use and the brightness is  decent but  the issue with the space bar makes it  basically unusable.Also, the cord  is really short. My fault  for not reading the specs clearly  enough, but worth noting.

  Let me tell you as pro-gamer this keyboard is the best budget keyboard out there! It has a perfect good feel to it and it's not noisy while typing. For those who look for a quit and RGB keyboard, this is the one for you. What makes this keyboard even much more surprising is the RGB. You can increase or decrease the lighting. Change the way the RGB moves or even chose a static color you like. You like only RED then change it to read-only. You want only white backlighting and Boom there it is. This keyboard is not mechanical however playing games on it like Destiny was smooth and love the comfort on it. Also a plus the buttons are not squishy or do not wiggle like some other budget keyboards. I'm super imprese how well made and put together this keyboard is for the price. Trust me! Stop searching long hours for a budge keyboard and get this one. You won't regret it! Not dure about all those negartive reviews but from an office worker at the mornings and a gamer at nighs, this is a winner.

So I have updated the review to five stars from one star. Why?
Initially, when I made the purchase, the keyboard seemed to have every feature I was looking for. It has pleasing backlighting and the typing experience was good except that it would insert page breaks intermittently for reasons that escaped me and it was infuriating. I was past the return period, so I left a negative review on amazon. The company reached out and offered to send a replacement, on which I typed this review with no issues whatsoever.

I can say based on customer service alone, I can 100% recommend this keyboard. As a keyboard it does everything you could want, the typing experience is good, it is priced very competitively. I've used the volume function keys repeatedly and they work well.",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard RGB LED Rainbow Backlit Wired Keyboard with Red Switches for Windows Gaming PC (87 Keys, White)






",$42.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,John Wood,Do not pass this up,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2016"," I didn't buy this keyboard for gaming. I am a college student and I enjoy typing on a mechanical keyboard. I have been using this Keyboard for around a week with my MacBook Pro.

Once I opened the box I was enlightened by the weight of it. Its not too heavy and it's not too light. Seems like the right amount. The build quality is great at this price point. The plastic seems strong and sturdy. I did a flex test and little to no flexing. I haven't taken it apart but it feels like they have a metal plate inside for structural support and what gives this little guy that extra needed weight.

The plastic for the key caps seem a little thin to me. When typing on the keyboard you can feel the quality of the caps. Slightly thicker keys would make this product perfect for me.

The switches are great! I am no expert at all but from what I have read they compare to Cherry MX Blues. These switches are very loud. I live alone so I don't have to worry about disturbing anyone. This switches are of great quality in my opinion. They feels sturdy and they do not seem cheap.

The led lights are great and it makes this keyboard look sexy. Each key has its own led and they are bright enough for everyday use. I do like how you can adjust the brightness of the light or you can just turn them off. I have noticed the LEDs will not stay at your setting once you turn your computer on. You will need to adjust it every time.

Overall I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this keyboard to anyone looking to save a few dollars.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard RGB LED Rainbow Backlit Wired Keyboard with Red Switches for Windows Gaming PC (87 Keys, White)






",$42.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,sofia ortiz,Glorious and epic,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2018","So I was hesitant to purchase this at first.
I had read some review somewhere on another redragon product, claiming that it was not true mechanical switches, blah blah blah.

I gotta say, this is probably one of the best keyboards I have owned so far.
I don't usually spend a lot on keyboards with the exception of a Razer DeathStalker Ultimate that I had bought one day to use for work (and it worked out perfectly, it literally did like 30% of my job for me lol, but it was $300 so .. IT BETTER :D ).

Back to the keyboard...
I was how they say. FLUUSSSHH WITTHHH CASHHH.
And thought what the hell I'll try one of their ""Mechanical"" keyboards, and if its a flop, then lesson learned...

Once I had the box in my hand I was already impressed.
The box it comes in is nice, and I can tell the product was heavy, which is usually a good sign.
Once I pulled it out, I knew that it was meant to be (that's what she said...)

It is pretty thick (doesn't bother me one bit)
It is heavy, (also doesn't bother me).
And because its heavy, it doesn't go sliding around the desk when I type at my nutty typing speeds.

The build quality is excellent, honestly, I don't know how they are making money because this thing is solid, and I bet I can weaponize it..
There is no bend or give to this thing, its literally like a rock, its a thing of beauty and brings a tear to my eye.

The red glow is intense and clearly visible even under the high-intensity interrogation style lighting they use at my office.
And the ominous red glow looks amazing, it fits my offensive IT role perfectly (I deal mostly in heartbreak, and ""Like A Boss"" situations)

The flip tabs on the bottom are heavy duty, and are super solid, like crazy solid, you flip them back and they sound like someone cocking a gun.
They literally SNAP! into place, I love it, I have been known to break these things off.. That is just not happening with this keyboard..
I think I might just snap them back and forth now if someone comes to bother me in the middle of an intense keyboard bonding session.

The keys themselves are beautifully designed, I love the font, it's not your typical boring look.
This thing says I break all the rules,
And its the type of font you want to send an email with, but know you can't because you will get fired when someone realizes that you've gone beyond their realm of times of new roman, and into a whole new dimension of professionalism...
They are crystal clear, no blemishes, and the glow comes through the keys perfectly, the glow underneath the keys makes it look that much cooler.

The mechanical keys are solid and work exactly as you expect, whether the actuation force is exactly what it should be, I don't know.
But they do the damn job, and I like to use my keyboards, not measure them in a full-on anal manner.
The click is fairly loud and obvious, and there is no volume knob on it, so that is something to consider if you buy a mechanical keyboard for the office.
I feel like this really does give me confidence in my high-speed typing ability as I am no longer wondering if I hit the key I wanted or if my keyboard had a derp moment (cause I don't make mistakes! YOU HEARD ME! {ok sometimes I do}).
I really do blast through my typing though, with ease and a sense of accomplishment ( cause I feel accomplished when I hammer out a memo and it literally feels like I hammered it out... That is mission accomplished right there!)
I am sure there are going to be moments when someone asks me questions whilst I am typing, and I am just going to keep slamming away while staring at them as I give them the look of ""I know what I am doing"", while confident clicking noises radiate from the dominion that is my office.

My boss came in and just immediately went wow mode on it, he loves it and stated that it makes him want to get rid of his laptop and switch to a desktop just to have a badass keyboard like this one.
I didn't mention that he could just hook it up to his laptop (MUAHAHAHA)
And thus my reign over awesome keyboards stays unchallenged (as planned).

Overall this thing is solid, and it makes a statement.
It says, now mechanical keyboards can now be owned by anyone and not just those who are less impulsive with their money.
I love it and I am going to buy 2 more, one for home (or should I call it my lair o.0) and one for my coming Mad (IT) Scientist Lab.

To the manufacture: good job on an excellent product!
I honestly didn't have confidence in your brand when I first made this purchase, I have never used your products but now I am a believer.
And don't change the price, I am still a cheap impulsive bastard and will have to panhandle if you do.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$42.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,Kaimonkey,An ACTUAL Mechanical Keyboard.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2016","Lets keep this review short and simple, You want a mechanical Keyboard, you can't really afford a mechanical keyboard, but hey this one is only a few bucks more than a similar membrane keyboard? why not this one?

Pros :
It's cheap AF. seriously, $30? that's like 6 pumpkin spice lattes.
It's actually mechanical, not like mechanical feel keyboards, you do actually get that sweet sweet clickity clack!
Backlit! Not only is it mechanical it's actually backlit too! and it's not too bright, just right, easy to see even with the monitor right infront of it.
Raised keys, a simple little touch, but makes the keyboard look that much better.

Now onto the cons:
There aren't that many cons really, at this price point it's bettery tactile wise than literally every keyboard out there, due to the fact it is an actual mechanical keyboard.
But the only real Con that I can find is that it says the switches used are a Cherry Green Equivalent, but they're not. They're a Cherry MX Blue clone if even that, a real cherry MX Green has about 70grams of actuation force, this keyboard has 55grams. I measured using quarters, it took 10 quarters to make the switch depress. But more on these switches, they say that they're Greetech switches, however I can't find the same or similar switches anywhere online! These switches might be a knock off of a knock off.....

but lets be honest, it's a $40 mechanical keyboard. that's actually mechanical. The only thing that would make this better, would be, slightly larger keys, I don't have little child hands. and possibly a wrist rest, but honestly? This keyboard is an incredible value and I would highly recommend it!",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

I like it much better than a laptop keyboard & maybe better than the standard dell keyboard I've been using. Only trouble I'm having is that the backspace key is a little too short for my short fingers to reach, but I think I'm already adapting. And I'm not used to having the backspace key on the number keypad, so I must adjust to that as well. The keys are textured & are already becoming very, very slightly discolored. I will have to clean them frequently.

The mouse works great and does not enter power saving mode too quickly, it takes several minutes of idle time to shut off. When it does, I can easily click once to wake it up without any trouble. It's a nice size for my small hands & has a very quite, almost silent click.

  I do medical record filing and was having some issues with my old keyboard. I liked the looks of this one and felt the reviews gave me a pretty good idea what I was getting.  It is definitely more basic than my previous one, but think that is what is working perfectly for me.  I have only had it for about a week and it did take me a couple days to really get used to the key placement, etc., but I am finding that it has the positive features I was hoping for.  It is compact for a full-size, but the weight helps keep it from sliding around.

  As far as value for the money goes, I was concerned about this keyboard/mouse combination. I bought it for my laptop because I work from home and sitting so close to my computer/hunching over it was killing my back. Most wireless keyboards haven't worked with my MacBook, but this works perfectly. I LOVE the number pad, as well! That was one of the biggest selling points for me. The mouse works excellently as well and can easily be adjusted using the normal system preferences. The keys are a little louder than I'm used to, but not distractingly so. My only two concerns - as a Mac user, I'm used to the command key being right next to the spacebar, but this one has the alt key and then the command key; my other issue is that it takes AA batteries instead of being rechargeable. Neither of these things warrant anything other than a 5-star review for me. It even arrived a day early despite the COVID delivery priority! Very satisfied.

  Day one review – very happy with my purchase!  I had previously purchased a name brand basic keyboard that must not have been full size.  Hated it!  Small, slippery glossy plastic keys that would stick and were hard to hit.  This keyboard?  Very quiet and soft touch.  Love the color too!  Off white base and muted turquoise /very dark sea foam-ish colored keys .  The larger keys are showing to be more accurate for my typing style.  Keyboard has a caps lock light, a num lock light and a battery level light…  Love those too!  Had trouble getting that very well attached sticker off the back of the keyboard showing where the dongle was housed.  Finally got it off and there was a sticky residue left behind but it was nothing that an alcohol prep pad (70% isopropyl alcohol) couldn’t handle…  The gripper feet on the bottom really keep this keyboard in place.  Included in the package were 2 generic AAA batteries.  There is “about” an 8 degree slope (rise) from the front to the back which is acceptable. No elevation feet at the back but when shopping for a new keyboard I discovered that fewer and fewer keyboards are being manufactured with that feature.  Too easy to break or always collapsing?

",$10.00 ,Verbatim,,Trauts,Inexpensive Keyboard / Mouse with Some Quirks,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2018","
  The price was very good for this combination of keyboard and mouse. The mouse and keyboard both work, but there are some disappointing features. Some keys on the keyboard are located in a strange place. There are ""extra"" keys (Power Sleep and Pause Break) located above the home, end, keys so the Home, End, Page, etc keys are pushed down a row. At first I found myself hitting the Scroll Lock key instead of the Home key, but now I am paying more attention.  The added keys were not necessary and caused a functional issue.  Another reviewer mentioned the backspace key--I should have paid more attention to their gripe. The key is located on the top row and is small like the other keys--I am not used to its location or size and these issues make it difficult to use. One final item is that the NumLock, and Caps have features that light up, but they are difficult to see. It maybe due to the angle I am seeing them, and this would have been a plus except that it doesn't function very well. Other than these issues the keys have a great feel to them, are responsive and provide good feedback.  The mouse is rather small and better suited for a laptop due to its compact size. The slick finish also makes it more difficult to hold. The rubber-coated scroll button feels firm and responds easily.

HIs on the other hand I hated if I had to touch the keyboard all the keys stuck, you'd spend longer trying to get a key to work than what it would take to type out an actual sentence on a working keyboard. The keyboards I replaced were low profile keys, they were flat, supposed to help keep crumbs and such from getting under them. But I wanted to go back to ""Old school"" keyboards ones I knew held up well to his computer game playing, and mad at people online on a game typing (throwing the keyboard down, typing hard etc etc.) Plus I just missed the big chunky keyboard feel.

I saw this keyboard for around $9.99 and got two, I am very pleased with it, I will have to get used to the backspace key being small again and the enter key being huge, but that's how I remember it being on the chunky key keyboards it's just been ages since I used one.

Even though it is a chunky key type keyboard it is not loud there is no mechanical clinking and clanking when I type, Really all I hear is a light clicking and it doesn't annoy me at al;, where as back in the day the loud clanking kind did. This is a regular sized keyboard, it has the Power/sleep/wake keys on it, has the led light above the keypad for when you have cap locks/num locks and or scroll lock on. There are no volume keys for sound, which I am okay with I have no problem using my mouse to turn my volume up on my taskbar, and honestly my last keyboard had it and it annoyed me very much, I'd go to hit my print screen button and hit volume up instead.

The keyboard over all feels durable yet light weight, it has the ""feet"" on the underside to prop it up a bit so you're not using it flat as a pancake, which can cause pain in your hands and wrist.

I wish the plug was a bit longer, but other than that I'm thrilled with the entire keyboard, and the cord is just a minor issue I'm used to a super long cord - probably way too long for a keyboard to be honest -

  Verbatim makes high quality blank CDs and DVDs, and also great keyboards! Our Windows 10 computer's keyboard's buttons were too shallow for my mother's liking, and it was also getting very dirty. Luckily, Verbatim has keyboards with deep keys, but with no volume buttons to adjust the computer's volume. Good thing the volume problem's easily fixable and no new programs and extra money are required! Walmart had a lot of keyboards ranging from $20 to $110, if not more, and neither of us wanted to pay up to $110 or more for one, heck no to that price! Good thing this is a high-quality keyboard with an easy USB hookup, even for Windows 10 computers, and we paid less than $8 for it total!

",$10.00 ,Verbatim,,Ronnie,An aggressively standard keyboard.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2018","Got this for my computer at work. I haven't touched the mouse because I had an existing one, so this blurb won't cover it.

I actually like this keyboard over the one that came included with a cheapo prebuilt HP. It has adequate spacing between the numpad, arrow keys/page/home/pause keys, and alphabet keys. Dead silent to type on. Has a little bit more key travel compared to generic chiclet keyboards. The keys are a little stiff upon arrival, so you may have to use extra force to register a key press during the first few months of ownership.

Quality is what you'd expect from a $9 keyboard and mouse combo. There's a frighteningly high amount of flex, though it doesn't creak like some much more expensive keyboards. Nice, no frills design which is inoffensive as it is slim. The 3 lights which designate caps lock, scroll lock, and numpad toggle are recessed behind a thin slit. While I appreciate being spared from yet another device shining light directly into my eyes, the lights are hard to spot unless your head is positioned almost over the keyboard. I squirm a lot at my desk at work, so I hardly see the light on unless I hover myself over to the right hand side of the keyboard. This is my biggest gripe with the nine dollar keyboard.

The key press feels nice, and the actual keys them self, feel very good. The USB wire is braided, which is always nice. The only reason I am rating four stars though is because of the price, if it was anymore, I would rate three; and this is because of the LEDs.

The LEDs give little to no customization, you have 3 lighting settings when using the most basic options. So, the brightness key controls the brightness of the LEDs, and the pulse key controls the rate at which the LEDs pulse. You have three preset LEDs to go through, and that's all you have. The only other customization features, are setting brightness, and you have a pulse option. It doesn't have any software to go along with it, and I haven't been able to find any online. I would rate 3.5 stars if I could. This is just what you get for a 20 dollar keyboard.

",,NPET,Gaming,Khoa,It's pretty good to say the least.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2019","This is the first time I purchased and use this gaming keyboard. I seen it around before in Fry's electronic but thought I didn't need it until later on I got a new laptop. The reason is I need a gaming keyboard is because I didn't want to abuse the laptop key letters (mainly the ASWD and space bar etc) so often to the point it would lose its durability sooner than later.

So I went for this gaming keyboard. And now I want to share some thoughts about it.

What I like about this product:
It looks awesome. I like the design behind it as well as this interesting placement with the space bar. It's got LED lights and doesn't really require to download a driver since it simply operates just fine like a regular keyboard once you plug in the USB. (But just in case, read the instruction...)

Now what I don't like about this product:
This keyboard is rather...big. Maybe too big for my hand to the point I start to feel ache on my wrist and thumb. This is due to that unique space bar placement I mention. I mean it's good in some way just because it's different. However, if anyone with a same size as my hand have trouble with it, then it could be a problem.

Then again, I gotten use to playing my left hand on the laptop keyboard since the gaps between the keybinds i click are very short so I'm willing to give this product a chance for a bit longer.

Overall result:
I give it 4/5! However, I do want to give reminder to gamers with small hands: Please be sure to check the measurement size of the keyboard to ensure you don't strain your hand too much.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

  This review is for NPET K10 Wired Backlit keyboardShort version - looks cool from a distance.  But is miserable to type on and the LEDs lack adjustability.  Ok for your 10 year old to beat on.Looks OK, and for under $15 what do you want?  Well, I for one would LOVE to be able to change the rainbow brite backlights to one single color.  Blue, red, etc, something.  I have not discovered a way to do this.  The instructions say (and comments on reviews are the same) that FN+Page UP changes LED modes.  This did nothing for me, as far as I can tell FN+Page UP = brightness UP, FN+Page DN = brightness down.  The ""LED"" light key (directly above the HOME key turns the LEDs on or off, or through one of 3 rainbow modes.  Note, these are STATIC rainbow modes, it doesn't shift or change colors.  If you FN+LED or FN+HOME, it enters a ""breathing mode"" where the lights pulse in and out.  THAT IS IT.The printed and online instructions are wrong, or maybe for a different model keyboard.FN+↑ =light up = WRONG, this is actually FN+PG UPFN+↓=light down = WRONG, this is actually FN+PG DNFN+HM=7 constant colors (7 modes) = WRONG, enters breathing modeFN+PD=turn off the light = WRONG, this dims the LED lighting brightnessFN+INS=LED colors cycling = WRONG, this does NOTHINGFN+PU=Customized led lighting =  WRONG, this increases the LED lighting brightnessFN+DEL=Running RGB lighting (2 modes) = WRONG, this does NOTHINGFN+END=7 colors/1 colors breathing (8 modes) = WRONG, this does NOTHINGFN+«=LED spreading/breathing speed down = I don't even know what key this refers to.  Cursor?  If so, does nothing.FN+»=LED spreading/breathing speed up = I don't even know what key this refers to.  Cursor?  If so, does nothing.LED lighting aside. ... there is no height adjustment at all.  Even $10 keyboards come with little legs in the back to heighten or lower the keyboard typing angle.  NONE here.These keys... SPRINGY and SPONGY are the best words I can describe them.  Not predictably mushy like an OEM HP/DELL/ETC keyboard... but... bouncy?  Anyway... not great.  Oh, so many many typos I made while typing this.  Not enjoyable to type on at all.  And the keys are... raised?  Tall?  I don't know the best description, but they sit a lot higher than you would expect.It sort of looks like a mechanical keyboard, but with zero of the feel.All I wanted was an inexpensive, mediocre, backlit keyboard to use at work in a dark room.  Just typing this review.... no way I'm taking this junk to work.  So uncomfortable to type on and you're locked into rainbow mode.  Not worth my time or effort to return this thing... it will likely wind up in the dumpster or at Goodwill.Is it better or worse than the other sub $20 LED keyboards?  Hard to say.

Redragon S107-BA Gaming Keyboard and Mouse Combo Wired Mechanical Feel RGB LED Backlit Keyboard 3200 DPI Gaming Mouse for Windows PC (Keyboard Mouse Combo)






",$29.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,Dave,Mouse Colors only changeable with DPI switch and no software/drivers are available,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2020","If you're buying this for the RGB features you expect this mouse to match any color other than green and still be usable, you're in for a bad experience. Colors are dependent on DPI. Anything under green is too slow. Purple (the only color above green) is too fast for most applications. The DPI button also doesn't register a button press event (investigated with AutoHotkey), so it's not programmable. Even turning the lights off by holding the DPI button down leaves an ugly muted red color, so it kind of blends with whatever color you have selected.

The worst part, is that the mouse cycles through rainbow mode and has a beautiful cyan color. Once you move the mouse it goes away for a harsh red (slowest), blue (slow), green (only usable speed), purple (too fast for use). So yeah.

I also tried to open this mouse and mod it, but the casing is really cheaply made. It's an $11 mouse when purchased alone so I can't expect much there. Taking a screwdriver and trying to gently rotate the head to pop any of the casings or buttons leads to the plastic instantly giving.

  I am very pleased with this product. Previously, I used a wider keyboard; however, it was too wide to fit between the legs of the laptop stand I use. I decided to buy this one so I can have the stand closer to me, and I'm glad I did. I was skeptical before buying because the keys are round and there is space between the keys. However, the keyboard is very comfortable to use and the keys have a good feel; it's very easy to tell when I press a key, and there's just enough resistance. It's not perfect, however. The mouse is very good as well, except for one aspect (see the following). The biggest issue I have is that the up arrow and down arrow keys are VERY small. Another issue is that it's harder to use the mouse to take the PC out of sleep mode, I have to practically shake it vigorously or slap it down on the table.

I was iffy about the circle keys at first but I decided on it. This combo is amazing! The keyboard takes 2 AAA batteries and the mouse takes 1 AA battery (batteries not included). I've had these a week and I am so impressed. The keyboard with the cover on and the mouse are quiet so I can still type and click away while in Zoom calls where I don't/can't turn off the mic. The cover feels great on my finger tips and makes typing easy. The circles make no difference. They're both light weight. The set up was amazingly easy, I just inserted the USB into my laptop and it set itself up on it's own! I did have batteries in and both mouse and keyboard turned on before connecting the USB. I'm just thoroughly impressed 👌 My one tip is to remember to turn off the keyboard and mouse after you're done for the day.

  I ordered this keyboard to get rid of the wires on my desk at work.  It has more than exceeded my expectations. It's rechargeable, which means no extra money is spent on batteries every so often.  The battery life is also beyond real! I charged both the keyboard and mouse to full capacity exactly 1 month/30 days ago (the light indicator turns green when both are done charging - note there is only 1 charge cable but you can buy an extra for < $5 online, however, I don't see a need, just charge them one at a time) and I have not recharged either of them since then.  I use them for about 8-10 hours per day and I do turn them both ""off"" using the toggle switches at the end of the day. However, both have a ""sleep"" mode they go into if they are idle and not used for about 10 minutes if I walk away for a break. To awake each you just start typing or click the mouse. Both the keyboard and mouse have a very slim/sleek design which alleviates the pressure I usually experience on my wrists using other keyboards, as they allow my wrists/arms to rest flat on the desk while typing. Lastly, the ""noise"" level while typing was various... the keys were very quiet when typing with my fingertips.  After getting my nails done, my acrylic tips made quite the ruckus lol! But to my surprise, as shown in the pics, there is a clear, rubbery keyboard cover/film that comes in the packaging.  I don't know if this is what it's for, but I found that if I leave it on my keyboard while typing, it silences the loud ""clicking"" noises that my acrylic nails were making to a low tapping/thumping - MAJOR DIFFERENCE! I also gets tons of compliments when folks pass by my desk and see them because they're so sleek, modern, take up hardly any space and have no wires! I highly recommend this item and would buy again if I ever needed to!***REVIEW UPDATE***It's been exactly 2 months and 10 days (from August 18 to October 28, 2019) and my mouse finally went dead! LOL!  It was the middle of the workday, but to no dismay, the mouse worked again as soon as I plugged it in to charge - I didn't have to wait. I merely had to tolerate the charging cable on my desktop *sigh*.  I left it to charge overnight at the end of the day and today when I came into work it was fully charged again and I'm back to wireless!  Side note:  The Keyboard is still going.  I have not charged it since Aug. 18 (today is Oct. 29).  I might provide a final update once that battery finally dies just to give folks an idea of the battery usage time.

Tried to figure it out on my own, no luck.  A friend’s college age son was visiting and tried to figure it out.  No luck.  I went to You-tube - no instructions for this keyboard.  I was about to box it to send it back, but decided to look at the Amazon reviews just in case someone had posted how to connect to the bluetooth.  Thank goodness someone had posted a video under Related Video Shorts (under Features and Details).  Thank you Steven Perez!!!!!  Pretty simple - press the FN button simultaneously with the C button (bluetooth symbol on the key, hint hint).  And the keyboard pops up on your devices’ “devices”.  Hopefully, this will help those that encounter the same connection frustration that I did.  Love it.  The keyboard is a little heavier than I would like, but I can get over it.

If you're accustomed to using smaller arrows on compact keyboards such as this or don't use them often, it probably won't bother you.

The description for the keyboard states that it is not whisper-quiet, and I can verify this. There's less of a clacking sound than most keyboards, but it's still quite loud, with more of a pounding sound.

  This keyboard is quite nice for $7.50. It has dedicated media buttons. The stands are adequate and don't fall down if you slide them along your desk. The f-keys are spaced. The keys are nice and responsive and since they're slightlyraised they give a quasi-mechanical feel to the keyboard although it is still a membrane one. The only complaints I have is when I press the enter key down it has a minor stickiness to it and the USB cable is relatively short at about 5 feet.

Great value for the product. Very affordable, especially if you require a quick replacement or something simple like in my situation.

Razer Cynosa Lite Gaming Keyboard: Customizable Single Zone Chroma RGB Lighting - Spill-Resistant Design - Programmable Macro Functionality - Quiet & Cushioned






",$39.98 ,,,Caroline Kornelsen,Wonderful keyboard! I have had it for over a ...,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2018","Wonderful keyboard! I have had it for over a month, and I use it for gaming and lots of writing. It works great for all standard functions.

Pros
-Fantastic price
-Gorgeous lighting (backlit with strong colors and completely adjustable with total customization)
-Soft clicks, very quiet for a keyboard
-Zero issues with any of the keys or ghosting, which I what I would expect from a gaming keyboard
-Sturdy feeling, yet not too heavy
-Adjustable feet to suit the height of your hand. Very comfortable even for long periods of use.
Cons (all minor)
-For a while, the backspace and space bar squeaked when pressed occasionally. It was not very noticeable, didn't interfere with any of the functions, and disappeared after a few weeks. Only reason I am including it is because it did irk the perfectionist in me.
-Occasionally the driver doesn't boot up right, so the keyboard lights either turn off or revert to standard lighting. Easily fixed by opening the Synapse driver program.
-The customization driver could be more user-friendly. Once you get the hang of it, it's fun to mess around with!

Overall a fantastic keyboard for the budget. I wanted something that would work with my gaming, but also not be obnoxiously loud as I do a lot of typing. The Cynosa Chroma checks all of my requirements, and looks epic!

UPDATE 2/2019: I've now had this keyboard for a year and would not trade it for anything else. It still runs like a dream with absolutely zero issues. The lighting remains strong and no keys have needed replacing/repairing. I would give it 6 stars if possible!",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I have to say, before I would have given this a 5 star rating, but for some reason my keyboard would stop working, first it was the spacebar and then the rest of the keys, but as soon as it unplugged it and plugged it back in it would work again but only for about 10 minutes.  Besides that the lighting is amazing and the Razer software lets you do a ton of customization! However, I now have a Corsair k68 keyboard and I have to say wow the keyboard is amazing, the keys are so satisfying to type on. The razer keyboard while being fine is not as good, especially after using these. If you have never used a mechanical keyboard the razer will be amazing, but if you have used a mechanical keyboard the corsair cherry switches will be so much better and the Razer keyboard is a 2/5 at that point.

  The keyboard itself is excellent. The build quality is great, the RGB is awesome, and the fact that it is per key assignable is great! However, the Razer software isn't great, not necessarily the fault of the keyboard itself, but is necessary for the RGB to function. That leads me to the next aspect I dislike, the software has to be running on the PC in order for the RGB effects to work. Otherwise it defaults to a lame color cycle effect. Desipte those things I really shouldn't complain because for the price this is a excellent keyboard. I don't game, but I did want a cool looking keyboard that I could use everyday. They keys aren't super loud, which was a must for me living in a apartment, but yet they do make a satisfying clicking noise.

  I really enjoy using this Razer keyboard and I am actually typing on it now as I write this review. It's very comfortable and the adjustable feet let you pick a preferable height. The keys are comfortable and satisfying to press and are perfect for those who want a clicky feeling without creating too much noise. The colors are vibrant and the effects are beautiful to look at. My only issue is that the lights are under a white barrier which creates a mixture of colors if there are two different colored keys next to each other. This makes it hard to make preset designs for certain games as the specific keys you want to stand out, don't stand out as much as they should. Besides this, the keyboard is excellent. The response time is great, and I've had 0 problems when typing.

I wanted an early bday gift to myself and a rainbow keyboard was high on my wishlist, and I’m a budget shopper.
What makes this keyboard different from others is the main housing of the keyboard itself is clear, with a white underbed. So the lights show throughout the entire keyboard as well as the keys; whereas other keyboards the lights are really only visible around the keys.
The keyboard itself is also weighted and NOT cheap feeling. The structure of it is already raised so you don’t have to worry about that.
I personally haven’t tried the mouse as I prefer my wireless.

The keys are clacky but not overly clacky. They don’t have a “sharp” clack to them.
The keyboard itself has 3 light options: Fade in/out, Dim, and Bright. You can also turn it off if you need to.
The lights will auto-off after 5 minutes of inactivity too, which I like..

",$35.98 ,,,World domination,Works great and good quality,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019","
  The keyboard and mouse are excellent quality.  The sleep mode for the mouse works as described.  Ordered this a month ago and put in batteries that needed charging and were not able to run my TV remote.  This keyboard has run for a month on almost dead rechargeable batteries.....and I type on this 8-10 hours a day.Some people have complained about noise.  What??  This keyboard is more quiet than any non-mechanical keyboard or laptop keyboard I've ever used.  There is not such thing as a completely silent keyboard.  If that is your expectation, then you don't have much experience using computers.

",$43.99 ,FENIFOX,Gaming,J. Brown,So far I like it,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2020","I have a high end $$$ backlit gaming keyboard but it’s in a storage pod so until I can get down to my pod I wanted to get something similar at a much more reasonable price. I say this as I’m comparing this low end keyboard to a very high end one.

Honestly, after using this one for a few days it seems to fit the bill just fine. Old skool ‘responsive key feel’ that gamers appreciate; remember the standard white keyboards with the chunky keys from the 70’s-90’s? Yeah, that kind of tactile goodness—can’t beat it! I only wish it came in split keyboard form. Thus far the keys have been responsive and accurate. However, if this changes I will redo my review as this is the most important aspect of keyboard performance.

What I really like is the aluminum backer; I can sit wherever and have it in my lap or on other non-hard surfaces and there is ZERO flex, unlike plastic housed keyboards.

I’d prefer non-rainbow color options but I do appreciate that I can easily adjust the brightness or have the backlighting completely off (see the user manual photo’ if you didn’t get one.

The mouse seems fine as well; nothing compares to a high end weighted gaming mouse but this one is responsive enough for online MMO use (though probably not serious raiding) and certainly good enough for office work/browsing.

I purchased this set myself and have not been given any ‘incentive’ to write a positive review. I appreciate the time previous reviewers took to share their experiences with this product, which helped my decision to purchase this set.

I’ve posted a photo of the ‘user manual’ —a piece of paper that came with it in case anyone is missing it. Also the height of the keys, a couple of views of the open housing format, and the bottom surface of the mouse.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

",$43.99 ,FENIFOX,Gaming,,Perfect mouse for major gamers,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020","
  I bought this for my 17 year old when his gaming mouse started flaking out. He's a major gamer and was mega upset when his mouse would no longer do what he needed it to do. I started researching mouses and saw that the combo packs weren't that much more expensive, so I figured I'd surprise him with a new gaming keyboard too. He was absolutely over the moon when it arrived. The keyboard has a stylish industrial look to it. The entire top panel is metal. Once I saw it, I was worried that it would be uncomfortable when using it for long periods of time, but he said that isn't the case. It's ergonomic design and elevated legs on the top of the keyboard make it very comfortable to use. The hand-rest on the left side of the keyboard is helpful and very convenient. It also has a phone holder on the top left hand side, but he hasn't used that yet. The keys are floating and there are colors underneath. The lights look so cool and it's nice that you can turn them on/off and adjust the brightness. The keys are very responsive, which makes typing very smooth. My son is super impressed with the mouse. It's tons better than the one he had. Just like the keyboard the design is ergonomic. It's larger and fits his hand perfectly, so it no longer hurts after prolonged usage, like it did with his other mouse. Just like the keyboard, it has colors that you can change. The lights aren't necessary, but they look super cool. The thing that makes this mouse so great for gaming is that it has 4 different Dpi levels. For the optimal gaming experience, being able to adjust the Dpi level makes a huge difference. It affects the sensitivity and responsiveness of the mouse. It also allows you to adjust the pointer speed, which is essential in gaming. This mouse is responsive and works nicely with games that need the fast response times. The click rate is good and being able to customize the keys is helpful. The feature that is superior to his other mouse is the back and go ahead button on left thumb. It's very useful and he said it's great for his gaming. Overall, he's extremely pleased with this combo and would recommend it to all of his gaming friends.

",$43.99 ,FENIFOX,Gaming,Antonio Golden,epic keyboard. So much more quietter than my last mech/gaming keyboard.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 25, 2020","
  This steel, industrial inspired keyboard is like every competitive  gamers dream. The keyboard is definitely mechanical and has an immaculate response time im talking like .02 millisecond (my best estimate) response time with every button. The buttons are also really quiet which isn't always the case with mech keyboards so you can tell the manufacturer put a lot of time and detail into eliminating that annoying typewriter sound most other keyboards have. The design has an extra wrist rest slope attachment but you really won't need it because the design itself is pretty ergonomically designed. When you prop the feet up on the keyboard thd metal design has a curve in it thats also helps to allow your wrist to naturally fall into a straight line which is helpful for workers cause the straighter the wrist less likely to develop carpel tunnel at an early age so all of that has been thought of and addressed in the design alone. The colors and rgb lights a nice medium bright so at night its not polluting your gaming space with extra blinding rainbow puke lighting but its more subtle in my opinion definitely giving it that appeal to night owl gamers and workers/gamers that want a moderately well litndustrial design. The extra phone holder slot is an added bonus until I need my wireless charger then it becomes useless lol.

Wireless Keyboard, J JOYACCESS 2.4G Slim and Compact Wireless Keyboard for Computer,Laptop,Windows,PC,Desktop,Smart TV-Black and Grey






",$29.89 ,J JOYACCESS,,Barry J.,REALLY close to the ideal keyboard for a 'text' computer user like me.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 7, 2019","I recently bought a series of different wireless keyboards because the one that I had before, one that I liked a lot, went crump and I needed a replacement. Six or so keyboards down the research path, I think I've found one that I can live with VERY easily. All of the keyboards leading up to this one were semi-OK, but ultimately unsatisfactory in some disqualifying way.

I wanted wireless (Bluetooth or dedicated USB thingie) because my desktop is a busy place and the cord from a much earlier corded, USB full width keyboard was pretty much always in the way. I didn't think I cared about replaceable vs not batteries, but the unit that crumped had an embedded rechargeable Li-Ion battery that was rechargeable via a mini-USB jack. It was THAT non-replaceable battery that was unable to charge that caused the keyboard to become unusable.

I determined VERY early on that I wanted rectangular keytops because my finger-to-key aim was better than with round keys of really close to the same size. I thought I wanted Bluetooth, but after experiencing what I call 'resync delay' on several of the candidates, I determined that I probably wanted a more basic unit, maybe a more-or-less dedicated Win (PC) unit. I wanted low-travel keys because the keyboard that went kaput had them and not only did they feel much better, but I typed with fewer errors and I think a bit faster as well. I wanted those low-travel keys to be pretty quiet too; as close to noiseless as can be reasonably expected.

Several of the keyboards I tried and rejected were of the 'Bluetooth for Win, IOS, or Android' flavor and I ultimately realized that not only did I not care one way or another for that flexibility, but that it also introduced the previously-mentioned Bluetooth 'resync delay'. I wanted a less-wide keyboard, preferably without the numpad and those other keys that are customarily between it and the 'proper' letter keys. I wanted frequently-used text-editing keys to be single function keys, not invoked by having to ALSO press the Fn key or whatever other 'shift' mechanism was employed. I wanted an additional column of my most-frequently-used editing keys just to the right of the letter keys and return. I was willing to overlook an 'also' numpad if that additional column had End, Home, PgUp, PgDn, and Del, assuming that BkSp was not too far away. I wanted the F keys on the topmost row to do what they usually do, without having to use Fn or some other 'shift-like' key.

So, you may ask, how does this latest unit measure up. First, it's too wide (14.5 inches overall L- R) since it has the numpad, but because it has the extra column of my favorite editing keys, I already been able to erase from my mind that the keyboard is wider than it needs to be by a full 3 inches. The keys are rectangular, low travel, and delightfully quiet. It uses a dedicated USB dongle-ish receiver that needs no configuration, pairing, or other involvement by me. The driver auto-installed as soon as I plugged it in. As far as I'm able to determine, it is an exclusively Windows keyboard, and I'm using it with W7 Pro on a homebrew mITX system. Right now, drawing near to the end of it's first full day of use by me, I have only one suggestion for change - make this same keyboard without that (to me) unnecessary numpad.

Until that suggested unit appears, I'll be happily typing on what is probably the best keyboard I've ever used. I'm REALLY happy with this unit; happy enough that I don't regret the time or expense associated with finding it.

",,NPET,Gaming,Vito,Horrible RGB brightness,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2020","
  I really wanted to like this keyboard, but there are a couple things that I just could not get over. First, the lighting on the keyboard is probably the worst I have ever seen on any keyboard. 80% of the keys are dim even at night and the transparent part of the keys are too thick so it doesn't allow much light through to begin with therefore causing a really bad experience to find keys even at night. Some keys you can't even read during the day because of the textures/quality of the keys' faces. Now that I could get over since I don't look down very much when I type anyways, but the one thing I couldn't get over is the placement of the backspace key. For some reason they decided to change the size of the backspace key to a single key and put the backslash key to the left of it to take its old space. This also changed the shape of the enter key since that's where the old backslash key was before which makes the enter key extra large as well. I'm not sure why they decided to do this, but it makes typing a chore when I keep accidentally pressing the backslash key instead of the backspace key. This is especially annoying considering I am a student majoring in web design and programming and I use classroom computers, my laptop and my home desktop which all have different keyboards. This means that once I get home to this keyboard I have to remember to change the way I type because of the tiny backspace button, but switch back once I go to school. Like I said I wanted to love this keyboard and yes the feel of it is pretty good, but I just could not get over the setbacks that it comes with. If these problems won't bother you then maybe it will be a good purchase for you. As for me, I will find a different 87 key keyboard with a normal key layout.

I have an ""office"" in my basement, and I do prefer the darken environment and quite often work at night, so it's great.- There are three (3) stationary color schemes (left to right on the keyboard): Green, orange, red, violet and blue; red, pink, violet, blue and green; or yellow, violet and teal.- There are three (3) levels of brightness (fourth level is off).- The is a breathing style lighting for each color scheme, at about a 4-second cycle (from off to the brightest setting and repeat).I have used this keyboard for my Chromebook and Windows Laptop.  The media/accessories keys works best with Windows 10.  The accessories keys are accessible using the ""FN"" key and the function keys to activate the calculator, volume, etc.The only con for me is the ""Backspace"" key isn't the traditional rectangular size, so my right pinky finger doesn't naturally stretches across.  So, I normally would hit the ""\"" key by accident, and if I conscientiously try to overstretch my pinky, I end up hitting the over-sized ""Enter"" or ""Insert"" key.Other than that one con.  The price that I had paid for this keyboard to type stories, and occasional Minecraft, is definitely a great substitute to other highly priced keyboards without a numeric pad.

  This keyboard solved my space problem. My desk has a 12"" x 24"" drop down keyboard platform which needs to hold two keyboards and two mice (trackballs) for two computers. It is a corner desk and each wing already has a keyboard, trackball, monitor and computer. I am well into my 70's and the back-light is essential - if I use a bright desk light, the monitors wash out. The other three keyboards are HCman notenkey's and I needed a different keyboard so I don't get confused about which computer I am 'talking' to. This keyboard has 11 function key combinations just to control the LED back-light effects, which I guess is supposed to appeal to gamers. I am not a gamer and just need a bright, easy to read, back-light, which this keyboard has.The keyboard has the standard fold down tabs to increase the tilt.

  I like this keyboard overall. While it is a membrane keyboard, I like the 'clickiness' (if that's a word). I also like the size, as I don't have space for a full 101 key keyboard at my desk. The colors are nice as well. One thing I don't really like is that the backlighting goes off after the keyboard hasn't been used for a few minutes, or the computer is put to sleep. If the room is dark, this makes it difficult to type the password to log back into the computer, as you can't see what the keys are without the backlighting. Also, the way the backlighting works, it's hard to see the smaller symbols on the keys (particularly in the number keys in the top row). These are small irritations, but not show-stoppers. Overall, I like the keyboard.

  Talk about a super-sleek wired keyboard and mouse!  I’d never heard of Jelly Comb before now and if people are doing their research before buying, more and more people will hear of them in the future.I’ve used Microsoft keyboards explicitly and thought I’d see if this was any better.  It wasn’t a gamble at all to find out first had it is quality with good construction.  .I plan to use this keyboard in conjunction with my 2-in-1 laptop and have for video editing.  It came with an interesting thin rubber cover -I assume to keep the keys clean and free from debris.  I don’t feel it necessary so I am using without.  The keys on their own are plenty comfortable.  Sensitivity is great with quick reaction time and no missed keystrokes.  The mouse is super smooth, looks sleek, and simple to use.  Best of all it is whisper quiet when clicking.I’m going to make this combo (mouse & keyboard) my travel kit because it is so quiet and won’t disrupt anyone at the coffee shop while I can quickly get through my work.

Wired Keyboard and Mouse, Jelly Comb Ultra Thin Full Size USB Wire Corded Keyboard Mouse Combo Set with Number Pad for Computer, Laptop, PC, Desktop, Notebook, Windows 7, 8, 10 (Black)






",$23.99 ,,,Paul Luciano,"Decent Keyboard/Mouse set, but some notes about the keyboard","Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2020","Pros: Keyboard has little space around keys for dirt to accumulate, key clicks are strong, mouse is good quality, eco-friendly packaging

Cons: Keyboard layout is not standard, Function keys/Secondary functions are inverted, No Scroll Lock light

Upon recieving the package, I was pleased to see that the keyboard and mouse were shipped in simple cardboard boxes. There was bubble wrap pouches, but none of the excessive plastic.

The keyboard and mouse are of good construction and the company ships a removable protective film that can be placed over the keyboard to keep out dust and debris.

The wires that connect the devices to the computer are thin and pliable so they don't require much effort to straighten out or manipulate to get them to out of the way.

The mouse is very slim in comparison to other Jelly Comb (aka JC) mice I have purchased, so for people with hands of my size, it is very low profile. Not unusable, but a lot slimmer than I would prefer.

The scroll wheel is very well built with a nice silver accent on each side. Detents are good and the ridges on the wheel give a good tactile feel. The extra button is for changing mouse sensitivity.

The keyboard is slim and lies very flat on the table. There is no palm rest, so I utilized a gel rest to prevent any carpal tunnel issues. There are no risers under the keyboard, so you cannot change the angle, but in general the angle seems decent.

Typing on the keyboard produces good quality clicks and response is very good. I enjoy typing on the keyboard, although I prefer mechanical keys. I recommend this keyboard because of the key response.

There are some things I do NOT like about the keyboard. JC decided to make the keyboard more compact vs. regular size keyboards, despite the fact that I bought the standard size keyboard. Because of this, they removed a lot of the space between the keys in the top row. There is no space between the Esc and F1 key, or between the F4 and F5 keys.

There is a dedicated Fn key to the right of the left Ctrl key which is necessary because the standard setup is that the Fn keys and their Secondary function are inverted. F5 also is Play/Pause. The problem is that when I go to press F5 (refresh), the key starts/stops playing audio or video I might have running. The Esc key acts as a Fn Lock, but there is no indicator light for this. Once you press the Fn + Esc combination the Fn keys revert to their standard setup, but this is a bit annoying. I expect that if there is a reboot, you have to remember to press the Fn + Esc combination again to revert to the standard setup.

The PrtScn button is not grouped with the Scroll Lock and Pause|Break buttons.

JC has added a Clear button to the right of Pause|Break which is puzzling. The number pad on the right works fine, but they added an additional Backspace button breaking up the + button so it is not the standard size. Some people who use the number pad might find this annoying if they mistype while working.

Finally, the three lights in the top right corner are Num, Caps and Power. There is no Scroll indicator light. I will agree that most people probably do not use the Scroll lock button, but there are two problems in my opinion. First, I have diagnosed issues that people have by noting that they accidentaly pressed the Scroll lock button as indicated by the light. No light, means it would be harder for me to diagnose issues related to it. Second, I have no need for a power indicator light on the keyboard. I don't have the ability to turn the computer on/off from the keyboard (by pushing one button), so I fail to comprehend the need for such a light.

Overall, the kit is good, but note the issues as I described, and decide for yourself before buying.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  Love the low profile yet snappiness the keys have to them when you press in. I'm very used to thinkpad keyboards but have switched over to a desktop setup recently. I wanted something pretty similar to my laptop keys and was contemplating getting the thinkpad trackpoint keyboard II for my desktop but decided to give this a try instead. This keyboard feels quite nice and snappy similarly to my thinkpad so I am very happy with it because I hate mushy keys. The keys, especially the space bar, isn't wobbly or  loud which is something I find common with a lot of budget keyboards. To compare, I have the essential lenovo keyboard because I wanted something as similar to thinkpad keys as I could find, and that one sucks so bad compared to this one. That keyboard is heavy and built well, but the keys are so wobbly feeling when pressed in. I also have the amazon basics keyboard and that one feels a bit more mushy and has a higher profile than this one. I love the silicone cover that came with this. At first I thought I wouldn't use it but it's great. It keeps your keyboard clean and has a grip to it so your fingers don't slide around when typing. I actually think it helps me type faster and not make as many errors.This keyboard defaults to the shortcut keys, but all you have to do is hold fn and esc to switch it to function keys and it will stay like that.

",$28.99 ,,,Mystik,"Quiet, Responsive, Quality","Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2020"," I was looking to purchase a cheap wireless mouse and keyboard for my spare laptop I have attached to my giant wall mounted TV. I didn't want anything fancy, as the laptop is only used to stream YouTube and other streaming services, browse the web, and do some light gaming. With this in mind, I didn't want to spend a lot on something insanely fancy for such a small task. So I set myself 3 needs and a budget.
Need 1: Wireless capability with good response time. I have 2 cats and cannot risk tons of wires all over the floor for them to tangle up in or tear up. They're well behaved but sometimes the zoomies overtake them and they get a little excited. It happens. This product is wireless and only requires 2 AAA for the keyboard and 1 AA for the mouse. There is little to no noticeable lag from input to receiving it on the laptop.
Need 2: Quiet. Sometimes I like to plug in headphones and watch movies late at night without bothering my partner. This would be a moot point if the keyboard and mouse were loud and annoying. This set is possibly the quietest I have owned. Sometimes I'm unsure if I've clicked the mouse or certain keys because they're padded and quiet. The feedback from my TV is the main way I know.
Need 3: Quality. I didn't want to spend a lot for essentially a spare keyboard and mouse, but I also didn't want something that would be DOA or die in the first few uses. I am happy to say that this set is sturdy and great quality for the price point. Both pieces are comfortable and weigh enough to let you know they're not made of air, but not enough to be a real concern or annoying to have on the lap.
Lastly, this was well within my budget as the last wireless mouse and keyboard I purchased from a retailer, in person, and advertised to be quiet (and wasn't) was nearly double the price of this product. The price for the perks of this product cannot be beat.
Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and am happy to recommend it.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$28.99 ,,,JoelW,"This is a solid, full sized keyboard and mouse","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2020","I have been using this keyboard and mouse for nearly a week now and I've found it very comfortable and natural to use. My hands, wrists, and fingers still feel good at the end of a full-day's use. Key placement is great; I've had no issues typing and it took literally less than a minute of use to feel like I've had this keyboard for a long time.

The keyboard does not have legs to raise the angle, but I feel like it doesn't need them. The angle of the keyboard as it naturally sits is great, and feels very comfortable even after long periods of use. The keyboard click does have a sound slightly less than a heavy mechanical keyboard, but I like it. The keypress is very responsive and along with the click of the keys, the feel is such that you never miss a keystroke.

A nice surprise is the built-in phone holder. I didn't expect I would use it, but I found it's a great place to keep my phone throughout the day without cluttering my desk. It holds the phone at a great angle and allows me to easily see incoming texts, or switch playlists without having to pick up my phone every time. Very convenient.

The mouse is a nice mouse too. I would call this a medium-sized mouse, and while it doesn't feel big, it fits very well in my hand and is very responsive in clicks, tracking and the roller-wheel. It's nice that both the keyboard and mouse connect to the computer via a single, very small dongle. No setup required, just turn on the keyboard and mouse, then plug in the dongle and you're good to go.

  This is my second jelly comb wireless keyboard/mouse combo (for my home desktop), so I knew to expect excellent design and functionality, but this full form set blew me away with how nice it looks, and with how much obvious thought and effort has went into designing and making it.  When I first opened the box, I thought, wow...The fit/finish is impeccable.  The rounded keys are very reminiscent of the 1930's era manual typewriters.  It makes me feel good just looking at the darn thing, and that's not something you'd think you say about a keyboard/mouse.It's not often you find a company/product that really goes out of its way to excel and make something the best it can be for the end consumer.  Really excellent design.That said, the reason I got my original jelly comb set, and this second one also, is because this brand is the ONLY one I've found to date that has the mouse technology that lets it work, stutter free, on tough surfaces like white table surfaces, or on tough fabrics (especially useful if you like to use your mouse in bed or on the sofa).  I've bought many much more expensive mice in the past that for some reason, will not work right on these tough surfaces.  This one does, and it just works right out of the box.  The mouse works smoothly, works in games, works when you transition back and forth to windows 10 from various apps.  Physically it feels perfect for my hand.  I use rechargeable AAA and AA batteries, so going with this set was an obvious choice.Very glad I bought this, Jelly Comb doesnt disappoint.  I hope other people give this a try, it's that good.

  Now that I'm working from home, I find myself using my computer even more than normal, so I was in the market to upgrade my peripherals.  I looked around for a keyboard/mouse combo - it was important to me that they be wireless USB (not bluetooth) and that they be linked to the same USB receiver to limit the number of ports I had to sacrifice from my computer.  This combo seemed like a good budget option so I ordered it, knowing that I could return it if it felt too cheap once it arrived.  I'm pleasantly surprised!  The set up was indeed plug and play, although there were no instructions on which direction to place the keyboard batteries.  Everything else was very self-explanatory out of the box and is working wonderfully after only a few minutes!  The keyboard will take some getting used to because of the shape of the keys, but they are easy to press and do not cause any fatigue in my hands.  The keys are quiet for the most part, except for a slightly louder click in the space bar.  The angle of the keyboard is comfortable for me as well, much more so than my laptop.  The mouse is fantastically quiet, with just the slightest tactile click to let you know you've pressed a button.  The scroll wheel has a rubberized texture that is also pleasant.

  It's an okay keyboard.  Out of the box it will run away when I try to type on my desk - I added four rubber footies at the bottom of it and now it's great.  Keys are light and fluffy.  One weird thing is that they pushed the |\ key next to the += key instead of having it directly above the enter key...so be aware of that if that kind of thing bothers you...

  My job gave me a computer with a crap ass keyboard that had broken feet and the previous guy's nastiness all over the keys.  I could have waited for them to slowly decide when it was in the budget to replace a crap ass stock keyboard with another crap ass stock keyboard, but I decided I had waited long enough.  If I am going to spend the better part of 8 hours staring at a computer, I might as well make it my own.  So I dropped a couple of bucks and got a keyboard and mouse that would be complete overkill for an office environment... and it's perfect.  Why?  Because now my boring ol' office has some uniqueness to it, making me forget I am trapped at a desk.  Now I am trapped at a desk with peripherals that are much better than anyone else.  This may not be a big deal to you, but in my mind, it's better to do the mundane tasks on a keyboard that visually distracts me with colorful bliss.  The mouse takes the feeling of dread I had from clicking that worn out stock mouse and gives me the excitement I need to not only click, but DOUBLE CLICK as well.  I'm sure i could play games and other things with it too.So why did I buy a gaming mouse and keyboard for an office computer?  Because I'm awesome.  That, and think about it... gamers sit there for hours double-clicking to use the Sword of Gondor repeatedly, so it must be comfortable.  Logic.

",$36.98 ,Redragon,Gaming,Jon Almada,Great keyboard. Mouse... Out of box mouse issues - UPDATE 12/2019 - Great mouse/keyboard combo!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2018","I bought this combination, expecting it to work out of the box. The Keyboard is beautiful and does a fine job of working for what I intend it for. The mouse... No spring back for either left or right mouse buttons. I am a little more than peeved at seeing this obvious factory issue make it all the way to my doorstep. Still mulling over what to do - I may send this back. Poor quality control.

Update: On closer inspection, the mouse had been misaligned at the factory and the top and bottom pieces of the mouse body were not aligned correctly. I watched a video on YouTube for this mouse as to how to disassemble and reassemble the mouse and after a few minutes I had the mouse repaired. I *WILL* be covering this on my YouTube channel since I plan to review this combo set.

One more item: Redragon makes it VERY clear that software is included with this package. It is most certainly NOT. And they go to great lengths to hide the software from the end user. I have found what I believe to be the software links, but plan to test before I share them here. I will bump up the review one notch if the package works out well over the long haul, but given the mouse issue right out of the gate and the promised software NOT being in the box plus the poor web site support to find the program, I cannot reasonably give Redragon a 5 star rating until these items are corrected.

Update: December 2019 - I was able to correct all the issues with that first mouse and the software works just fine. I've since bought this combination of mouse and keyboard 3 more times and had no issues. This truly is a great keyboard/mouse combination and I've made it a standard setup on the 3 gaming systems I've built to date. Software is indeed on their website but it is a little strange to find - The mouse is on the website as ""Redragon M601-3 CENTROPHORUS 3200 DPI Gaming Mouse "" and has two downloadable executables - The Windows 10 version works just fine. I rarely run the software since it works fine without it but it is nice to be able to change the mouse parameters if needed.",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  I bought this for my kid so I wasn't too concerned about what I thought about it for a low cost keyboard and mouse combo. They just wanted the lights. But after using it myself on their system, I have to say the mouse and keyboard actually feel and work really really good!  And the LEDs actually look really good on both of them too! They beat up both a lot and still work after 4 plus months with no issues.While I am still planning to replace my workhorse basic keyboard with a programmable RGB like the Corsair K70 RGB or something by G.Skill or Logitech; if you are looking for a great budget combo with lights. This ones feels great to type on and looks great too for the price. I really am shocked. If you are building a new system and want to space out spending money on the really nice gaming keyboards, or refreshing the experience on and old system with worn keyboard, this is a great option.

  I've only been using the keyboard at work for about week, and so far it's been great. I like that I can select a 'solid' color (vs multiple colors) and each day I change the color (Fn+Home) - I've received lots of comments on the cool colors. The keys are a perfect distance from each other & are easy to press. My old MS keyboard at home forces me to use more pressure on the keys & therefore I find I make more typos. I don't have that problem with this keyboard. The only thing I miss having is a button for the calculator.I like the mouse too. The only complaint is that sometimes my forefinger doesn't automatically find the scroll wheel (it's between two ridges that are slightly too high) & I have to look at the mouse to find it.

",$23.99 ,OMOTON,78,Pink Panther,In-depth review,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2019"," Alright, I’ve spent the last month using this and I figured I would give my review. I’ll do my best to give a few characteristics that I feel are important and then I’ll leave a summary at the end. Feel free to skip to the summary if you don’t want to read all of this.

Typing: This is the main reason I love this keyboard. It has a “normal” keyboard feel to it. If you enjoy a Mac style/thin keyboard button layout (I mean the height/thickness of the actual buttons), this keyboard isn’t for you. I like thicker buttons that feel like a traditional keyboard, because I can type faster with it.

Connectivity: Another important aspect of a Bluetooth keyboard. It does lag a bit, but I have a high(er) typing speed (I usually type around 75-80 words per minute). But it does a good job of keeping up and it gets the job done.

Battery life: I guess it depends on your use and the type of batteries you purchase. I’ve left the keyboard on for days at a time, because I forgot to turn it off and it still works a month after I purchased it.

Ease of use: I use this with my iPad Pro and it took a few seconds in order for it to sync with my Bluetooth. I have no complaints about this aspect of the keyboard.

Summary: I’m going to rank this product five stars, because I never have any issues out of the keyboard (no malfunctions, major problems, defects, etc) and it gets the job done. It was easy to connect, it uses a small amount of battery, great keyboard feel for those who love “traditional” style keyboards, and it is extremely portable.

  I bought this to work with my new (gen 7) iPad and I have not been disappointed.  First, there's the look.  I have two kinds of people come to my house: people that appreciate a good deal, and pretentious jerks.  People in the first group have commented on the ""Apple"" keyboard I bought and were pleased to hear that it wasn't Apple and that I didn't have to sell a car to buy it.  People in the second group have commented on my ""Apple"" keyboard and I just let them think I have money to burn.The setup was a breeze.  Turn it on, pair with the iPad, done.  We just leave it sitting there and it works when we need it, it goes to sleep when we don't need it.  It's been running on the same set of batteries for months and hasn't missed a keystroke.There are plenty of options out there for a bluetooth keyboard, but this hits the sweet spot of look, price and functionality.

  Since Covid-19 all my classes are now virtual and online which makes it hard on my neck/back to have the monitor at desk level so I have my lap top on a riser for the monitor which makes it way more ergonomic. As you can imagine though the keyboard on the riser is not comfortable at all for typing. This keyboard has made all the difference in having a comfortable working desk set up. It is lifted on the top side which really helps make it ergonomic for my wrists. The only feature I wish it also had was the light on the actual keyboard the way the MacBook Air keyboard has. The keys are pretty much exactly like the Mac keyboard except for that one feature. Either way I love this keyboard!

",$20.99 ,VicTsing,Gaming,Christopher Lu,Highly recommend for its price and comfortability,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2018","Highlights:
Inexpensive and feels like a very high-quality keyboard (at least compared to my former Dell keyboard and the many Mac keyboards I have used). The keystrokes are quick and responsive. In addition, the lighting effect is really nice for the price. Finally, while the tilt is not adjustable, the typing angle is not an issue in my opinion.

Cons:
While the keyboard has a weird layout, it personally took me less than an hour to assimilate to the new keyboard structure. In addition, the lighting effect is created by a light board behind the keys, not the keys themselves.

Overall Assessment:
For a high-grade, reasonably priced keyboard this absolutely fits my repertoire. But even if you are gaming in the dark, I think it's still COMPLETELY fine to type. I would definitely recommend this for both gaming and personal use because the product is THAT good!

  I am fed up! with poorly constructed keyboards, esp with sticky space bars.  My last KB failed to respond HALF the times I wacked the space bar.  This KB types great.  I'm left handed, and while I prefer a left hand KB, the only 2 choices on the market, which I've both used, are lousy for typing.  This KB has a layout that is well thought out, with enough space between key groupings, to help avoid overreaching and accidentally pressing the wrong key.  Also, the LED color zones help keep the fingers in the proper zone.  So this KB is easy to use, even for me.  The platform keys are a great idea; easy to keep the keyboard clean.  The mild ""click"" is on par with all other KB's and in no way a distraction.  The construction quality, including a METAL chassis, is nice.  The wrist support is non-existent, by the way.  The LED lights are fun/cool but can be switched off if needed.  I have already ordered a second KB for home.

I wanna start by saying KUDOS to the VicTsing customer support which by itself deserves 5 stars.. They contacted me and sent me a replacement and it so turns out that the two products that I ever ordered from VicTsing happened to be defective. Now there's no more sticky keys which, strangely enough, mitigated the accidental typos almost completely. Though I'd say the keys could be about a millimeter more apart.
The one star is for the LED backlights which are still useless but just makes the keyboard more aesthetically pleasing to look at in slightly darker environments. They could've upgraded the keys for the backlit ones for slightly higher price and that'd have made this the perfect budget keyboard.

Update: Two more days into it and I've started running into more problems.
1. The Space Bar gets stuck sometimes and there's no way to stop it other than to pull the keyboard out of the USB. And apparently it's not just the Space key that gets stuck but the arrow keys too. Happened right while I'm writing this.
2. There are a few times the keyboard goes completely unresponsive. No keystrokes register while the LEDs are still ON which means it's still powered ON. Doesn't work until it's pulled out and plugged back in.

I'l keep updating the issues as I notice them.

LED backlights are completely useless. They probably just threw them in there to hike the price a bit. You couldn't read a darn thing in even slightly darker environments. Don't fall for the bells and whistles.

The material seems fine and the keys are quieter than I was hoping for. Not much of a mechanical feel there. The keys are too tightly packed which causes for the typos way too often even for someone with a medium sized hand. It's a clear NO if you have bigger hands. And then there's the weird Enter key which would be really annoying until you get used to it. This is all with just two days of use and I'm already prepared to dole out some extra money for the Razer keyboard to replace this one.",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

  I wanted to write this review after 30 minutes of using this keyboard, but decided  to wait to have a better idea of what I liked and what I did not.  Really, there is not much that I do not like, but after researching keyboards for weeks, I know that keyboard features/attributes are a matter of personal preference.  This was an addition to my work setup, as I wanted to eliminate another unsightly wire from my desk.  I had a hard time deciding between Bluetooth and USB, as I had never used a Bluetooth keyboard before and was worried that it would be ""laggy"" and frustrating to use, but I am sick of dongles, so I went with Bluetooth.  I can think of maybe one time where the connection seemed to ""hiccup,"" but there was no way to know whether that was the fault of the keyboard or my laptop.  Othr than that, it has been pretty much flawless, and the keys are perfectly responsive.  they are VERY flat, which I was unsure about, but I like that much better than the taller keys that most keyboards have.  Like the keys, this is a thin and relatively flat keyboard as I tried to convey in the pictures.  Personally, I love that.  it is slightly raised in the back, but I am sure that some will lament the absence of pop out feet to raise it even higher in the back, but the angle is just right for me.  The connection to my iPhone is also seamless, although I probably won't use that feature much.  My only really issue is that I occasionally struggle to make sure that the function keys I want active are indeed active, but I am sure if I spent some more time looking at the instructions, that would help.  An additional bonus is that I don't see any fingerprints or smudges on the keyboard, which I have yet to clean.  I am more than happy with my choice.

",,Arteck,,Raj Against The Machine,"Great add-on for the stay-at-home office, definitely glad I got Bluetooth","Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2020","After the first week of working from home on my living room couch, I decided I needed to move to a more productive and less distracting space in my downstairs den. I have a PC there with a wireless keyboard but it uses a USB dongle. To use it with my company laptop I'd have to move the dongle from my PC to the laptop. (Yes I know, First World Problem.) My laptop only has two USB ports in it, and I'd hoped not to take up a precious USB port as I need the other for my Jabra. I also didn't want to keep moving the dongle back-and-forth between computers.

This has been a great alternative, in terms of price / value, convenience, construction quality, and features. They offer this in a cheaper version without Bluetooth, but I am glad I got this version. It took a couple triesd to pair with my laptop, but once I did it hasn't needed to be paired again since, and is fully functional. It has an on/off switch, but it will also turn itself off to save battery life after a few hours of non-use. Just tap a key or two and it comes awake.

It can be set up to work with up to three different devices supporting Bluetooth, including phones & tablets (but I haven't tried that yet). There are three different buttons to tell the keyboard which device to connect to, so I can also switch it to use it with my home PC.

It is thin and light, but the keyboard is almost full-size including a numeric keypad and arrow keys. This is nice for all of the Excel work that I do. The keys are somewhat flat and shallow, like the ""chiclet"" keyboards on some 80's computers, but I've gotten used to it. They have solid feedback, and I don't make many errors (except the ones I usually make anyway). One thing I haven't adjusted to yet is, sometimes when I want to use the left Shift key, I usually hit the Caps Lock key instead. I usually see my error and correct it, but I will have to adjust with time. Others here have noted the keyboard is not tilted, but I haven't found it to be an issue.

It is also very solidly constructed and good quality so far. As I'm writing this during the Coronavirus pandemic, I do try to disinfect it occasionally (at least a few times a week) with a light mist of either isopropyl alcohol or hydrogen peroxide, and a wipe-down afterward. This has caused no issues to battery life, functionality, or appearance. I haven't tried bleach, nor would I recommend it.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

VicTsing Mechanical Gaming Keyboard – Full Outemu Blue Switches Computer Keyboard, Fantastic Backlit Keyboard with Ergonomic Wrist Rest, Full Anti-Ghosting Wired Keyboard for PC/MAC Games, Black






",$34.99 ,VicTsing,Gaming,Spencer B,Solid entry-level mechanical keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2020","If you are looking for a good entry-level mechanical keyboard for gaming or every-day use, this is a great place to start.

The Great:
- Outemu blue switches. These are of the same style as Cherry MX Blues, so you get a satisfying tactile feel and audible click with every keypress.
- Solid construction. There is a sturdy metal plate that everything is mounted on, and it gives it a pretty satisfying weight and feel. The flip-out angle adjusters also feel steady as I type on them. It feels like it will last a long time.
- Compatibility. This keyboard was completely plug-and-play. I just plugged it in, windows set it up, and it worked from there on out. This has a windows layout, but I also plugged it into a mac and used it for awhile and it worked just fine. (not all of the function keys work on mac, but the volume keys worked perfectly)
- Feel. If you like blue switches, this keyboard feels great to type on. Also, every keypress is transmitted right as the ""click"" part of each press happens, which seems perfect.

The Good:
- Lighting. First off, this isn't a full RGB keyboard, but I wasn't expecting that based on the product description. The lights that you see in the picture are the only possible colors those lights can be. So the lighting is basically divided into 6 sections of red, orange, green, light-blue, blue, and purple. You can adjust the brightness and speed of each effect which I thought was cool. And using the brightness you can turn the brightness completely off, which I think is an important feature.
- Keycaps. The keycaps feel pretty good to type on and seem like they should withstand the test of time. The design isn't for everyone, but it comes with a keycap remover that you can use if you want to swap some out for your own keycaps.

Could Be Better:
- I think because the keys are mounted on a metal plate, if you're not listening to something else you can sometimes hear a sort of dull ""tinging"" sound as you are pressing keys. Not a deal breaker, it is just something else you hear while you're typing.
- Customization. There is no software included for changing keybindings, lighting effects, or other behavior. It doesn't seem to remember your last chosen lighting effect if you unplug it and plug it back in.

Summary:
Overall, if you're looking to get into the world of mechanical keyboards, you think you'll like the satisfying click of blue switches, and you don't want to break the bank, this is an excellent and solid-feeling mechanical keyboard for the money. There aren't a ton of customization options beyond the lighting adjustments, but it has quality blue switches that will hold up over time and the included keycap remover makes it easy to add custom keycaps if you decide to go for a different look in the future.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

",$34.99 ,VicTsing,Gaming,DasLooney,Great Intro to Mechanical Keyboards - A True Value,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2020","This VicTsing Mechanical Keyboard is a wonderful introduction to quality mechanical keyboards at a budget price! The keys use Outemu Blue Switches which are similar to Cherry MX blues and have a very satisfying click and responsiveness to them. They keys are mounted to a metal plate so this keyboard should last quite a long time. While the keys are lit up, it is not an RGB keyboard, as they individual keys cannot cycle through or be assigned their own colors. The keys are lit in 6 zones, each zone a different color. You can cycle, or animate the key light patterns, there are a total of 9 patterns and you can adjust the speed and brightness of the illumination from dim to super-bright or turn the illumination off entirely if desired. All lighting effects are done via they keyboard and no software is required.

They keyboard has a definite solid heft to it, with very little flex under pressure. It has a small built-in non-removable wrist wrest that doesn't get in the way or become uncomfortable during prolonged use. They key caps are removable, with the included plastic key-puller and can be switched around if so desired. This keyboard looks, feels and sounds amazing and is a true pleasure to game on. It provides the quality and looks of more expensive keyboards! It also has a built in height adjuster legs on the underside which are quite sturdy, so you can choose to have the keyboard laying flat or upwards at a tilted angle. Note: while the keys are indeed mounted to a metal plate and the internal superstructure of the keyboard is also metal, the outsides are comprised of ABS plastic.

Overall, quite the bargain at the price and it just goes to show that you don't have to break the bank to get a decent quality mechanical keyboard! Well done, VicTsing!",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

RK ROYAL KLUDGE RK61 Wireless 60% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Ultra-Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with Tactile Brown Switch, Compatible for Multi-Device Connection, White






",$52.99 ,RK ROYAL KLUDGE,Gaming,LQ,Fantastic wired/wireless 60% for the price and good for Macs!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2020","Was interested in diving into the world of mech keyboards but didn't want to spend 200 on a very intense keyboard. Thought I'd look at some interesting cheap options for wired/wireless keebs and go from there. I kept coming back to the RK61 based on online reviews saying that it was great for the price and I totally agree. For reference, this is my first actual keyboard purchase. All the other keyboards I've used in the past have been attached to the laptop, lol.

I chose 60% because I don't use any of the keys above the numbers line. Nor do I use any page up/down keys or home buttons, etc. It's super compact as a result and I love this part. Obviously, if you use those or want separate arrow keys, maybe consider a 65% or TKL or something. I do have to say I was super hesitant about getting this because I only use Mac. The fact that there were no Mac keycaps kind of bothered me and I didn't know how easy it'd be to switch functionality. I was also hesitant about the fact that the arrow keys were not separate, especially being in the design profession and having to use arrow keys quite often. Happy to say that the keyboard settings in the Mac menu are easy to switch around, making the cmd key the one closest to the spacebar and solving that issue. I don't really care so much about the actual keycaps saying stuff different as long as I know the functionality is there. And the arrow keys, honestly. Took a couple tries to get used to it but now (3 days later), it's very natural to me to hit the fn key while using the arrow keys. Please note, before you can use fn to use arrow key functionality, you must first (on the new model, at least) hit fn+enter in order to get it to shift to that usage. Everything else is fine!

Super happy that for about 50, I could get a wired and wireless version. I use the keyboard right next to my hooked up MBP and a monitor and have never experienced lag. I would use the wire but it looks messy and I like to keep my desk clean. Easy enough to charge at night anyway, when sleeping. Also really love the fact that this isn't RGB. I know some folks might want RGB (and I believe there is a version of this with it) but it was much too colorful for me and for my aesthetic, I wanted single color. The blue backlight is absolutely stunning with the white. Love it so much.

Brown switch is fine for me although I tried a version with red switches and it does seem a tad quieter because it's linear and doesn't make a sound on the upstroke. But that's all up to personal preference. I haven't tried the Bluetooth switching since I only got one device so can't speak to that. Even though there is only one backlight, there are still many options for light effects as well as dimming or brightening the backlight. Additionally, it feels weighty and feels solid and not cheaply made, another great plus.

One last thing to mention is that it does have to 'wake up' after a period of no usage. So whereas my Mac keyboard could regularly wake up the laptop on one click, I have to first click to wake up the keeb and then click again to wake up the Mac. No big issue for me but worthy of mentioning. Overall, amazing purchase as a first keyboard. I even purchased additional keycaps to get it to look a bit more custom!

Vote HELPFUL if this review was useful for you! It would definitely encourage me to write more reviews!",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I love the 60% keyboard layout, having come from a full membrane keyboard prior to this. I purchased the brown switch version and I am very satisfied with the level of clickiness but also less noise. I did have some initial trouble figuring out how to use the additional key presses it takes to swap between numbers and the F1-12 keys, and how to get the arrow keys working, but I always recommend just resetting the kb and restarting from scratch if you work yourself into a dead end. I highly recommend checking to make sure you're in the right mode, Windows or Mac, just in case you're not working with the right one and aren't aware. This small design fits right under my glass desk stand that I also got here on Amazon, and between my laptop sitting atop it and this kb underneath with a wireless mouse at the side, I have a very compact desk space with plenty of leftover space for my other study supplies, books, food, and iPad Pro 12.9"".

Microsoft Bluetooth Keyboard Black






",$42.99 ,Microsoft,,RantiFam,Very comfortable - but disappointed in keys,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2019","
  Bought this keyboard as I really liked my son's Surface Keyboard, but didn't want to pay close to $100 for one.  My needs were simple.Pros:- Bluetooth connectivity has been excellent!  I couldn't give up a USB slot, so this was the #1 feature I was after- Comfortable with good key feedback- Lightweight and compact (although I would not consider it a ""travel"" keyboard, it could easily accompany you on the go).Although the keyboard hit on all my needs, I was not expecting the lack of some standard keys and moreover the significant impact to the way I work.  To make this worse, I was under the impression that some/many of the keys could be configured, so figured I'd be able to change what I needed.  More on that below.Cons:- NO PRINT SCREEN button!  In my line of work I use applications like ScreenPresso and Greenshot.  Both of these make use of the PrtScrn button- The lock button is inconveniently placed directly above the Backspace key.  It's far too easy to inadvertently click on this key and lock your PC.  It's a little irritating when you're flying along and accidentally lock your PC.-  The ability to configure the keys is a joke.  After downloading and installing the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center, I quickly learned that only the [Media], [Prev. Track], [Play / Pause], and [Next Track] were configurable!  I'm not counting the [CAPS LOCK] and [Emoji] as ""configuring either of these is highly restricted and rather dumb (IMHO).  Could I configure one of the above media buttons as the Print Screen?  Yes!  However, this seems really stupid.  Of course that could be my OCD talking.Would I recommend the keyboard?  Yes - but I would make sure the person was very aware of the above limitations.Maybe Microsoft will extend the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center app to allow greater configuration...?!

  A mix of positive and negative, but mostly positive. On time delivery with Prime, easy to connect and use via bluetooth. I'm pleased with it, except for the fact that it is perfectly level. There are small round rubber ""feet"" to cushion and keep it from sliding on the desk, but none that allow for angled use (you can't ""prop up"" the back). Thus my 4 star rating for ""ergonomic"". For short term use on the desktop it is ok, but for lower, more ergonomic extended use above the lap it feels strained after a while (I am on the computer sometimes 12 to 14 hours a day). This is probably a good thing since I need to get up and take a break once in a while anyway. It is not silent - which is ok for me because I prefer to hear the ""click, click, click"" while typing, but some may not like it. The surface is easy to clean, with very little open space around each key (so crumbs & ""stuff"" doesn't get in easily). There are no lights to indicate when you have caps lock on. No power on/off switch. It auto connects when I turn on my computer. Overall a good buy in my opinion.

  Design of keyboard is minimalistic and compact. Keys are nicely sized.

Ok, first the package never arrived (but this was not the fault of the seller, it was stolen due to a bad neighborhood and confirmed by usps). That's not why I'm giving this 3 stars, though. Amazon gave me a fuss to refund or replace it and made me jump through a bunch of hoops that were practically unheard of from anyone else I've talked to that had a package stolen when en route from Amazon. Ok, dealt with that and still needed this keyboard, so I bought the same thing I ordered here from Target - again - to have a working keyboard for typing more comfortably with.

After a few weeks of light typing (an email every few days, checking the news, and ordering items from Amazon; not a lot of typing), I look down and see that the A key has started to disappear.

3 days later, I look down and see now that the S key is all about gone.

Then the D key.

The top of the F key is now gone, half of the N key, and the letter C has become an empty white block of blank.

The keyboard responds well to touch sensitivity and is quiet, but how are people supposed to see the keys if they rub off under a few weeks time?! What type of keyboard is this?

However, last night I spilled half a bottle of thick, rich beer into mine. After I shook & drained out most of the liquid it still worked, but by morning when the remaining beer had dried about a third of the keys were too sticky to operate. I immediately ordered a replacement, and while I was waiting figured I had nothing to lose by trying to fix the soaked one. After removing the screws from the bottom (don't miss the one under the QC sticker) it came apart pretty easily--and looked totally disgusting inside with years of debris accumulation. I carefully separated the ribbon cables connecting the keyboard proper from the small circuit board (didn't want to risk washing the electronics), and bravely gave the keyboard a thorough soaking with hot water using my kitchen sink sprayer. Propped it up vertically in a warm location to dry. I also scrubbed the top & bottom of the housing, with the circuit board removed.

After a few hours, when everything seemed dry, I put it all back together (the ribbon cables were a bit tricky), not really expecting it to work. But, it works perfectly! All the keys operate smoothly, and it looks almost like new. So, the replacement I ordered will be a spare to keep until the day when I find a more effective way to destroy the current keyboard.

I'm not giving this five stars because the feel of the keys isn't my favorite among all the keyboards I've ever used (I prefer clicky mechanical keys, which are difficult and/or expensive to come by these days), but this one is good enough and it definitely gets big points for repairability.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  It has its flaws if you have an iMac - for example the Num-lock and calculator does not work on Macs; but the numbers work in Excel for Mac. There are a good many shortcut keys also. I really love the forward delete button.  I also really love the snap-shot key where you click on it and you see numbers. Move the mouse (with numbers) to the upper left hand of the portion what you want to take a snap-shot of. Click and hold it down and drag across the top of the area you want to copy and then drag it down to the end of the copy. You must keep your finger down all this time. When you release your finger from the mouse, you will have an Icon on the desktop (a snap-shot of the area you highlighted). Double click on the Icon and you will have a snap-shot in the upper left hand corner of your screen to preview. You can save and rename the Icon on the desktop, just like any other Icon. There are no instructions on how to do this with the machine; that is why I am including it here.Internet sites can be deleted with the x (F1). The sound and mute keys are used a lot. The Fn key is used to access the lower part of all these shortcuts. For example on the Mac, the last two shortcut keys on the right are good only when you use the Fn with them to dim or brighten the screen. I have had no successes with them as a zoom key. With the iMac Magic mouse, you can sometimes zoom larger by tapping the mouse and your screen will start to get bigger and then it will start all over again.For Mac owners this is a wonderful keyboard.

That being said, I noted the box was not shrink-wrapped when I removed it from the Amazon box and then the keyboard plastic wrap was a bit askew. ""This couldn't be used, could it?"", I thought.

Then I tried to pair it with my MacBook Pro and saw the keyboard name in the list (see attached).

  I type on an Apple Magic Keyboard every day and find them to be easy to use, with very good battery life.  They easily pair with Macs, iPads, and Apple TVs.  I'm giving 5 stars for the product, but no stars for the sales experience.  The keyboard I received was obviously one that had been returned.  I buy Apple gear all the time, and the boxes are always wrapped in plastic -- this was not.  Upon opening the box I noticed the plastic sleeve the keyboard was in was upside down.  There's a small tab that makes it easy to pull the keyboard out of the box.  This was facing down, under the keyboard, instead of up.  And, the shipping box was way oversized for the product and had only two small pieces of packing paper, so the box was pretty well smashed.  Again, the product performs just fine, but I am returning it.  Used products ought to be identified as ""open box"" to buyers and not sold under the pretense of being new.

  I bought this to use with my iPad Pro 10.5. Love it. Pairs up via Bluetooth. I've had it for two days and have used it a few hours a day. It came with 85% battery, currently at 84% battery. Dropped a whole 1% in two days. Perfect. I love that it is a full sized keyboard, comparable to my MBP 13"". I also wasn't a fan of the Apple Smart Keyboard (the cover with the keyboard cooked in). It was just too cramped plus I already had a smart cover so no reason to have two covers. I found out that I could use this keyboard when talking to an Apple Store employee while looking at iMacs. We paired a keyboard up to an iPad and I was sold (although I bought it on Amazon because it is $10 cheaper compared to buying it from Apple). Since it is an Apple keyboard, the battery life shows up in the battery widget along with the iPad battery life and Apple Pencil battery life. Screen brightness and volume controls on the top work with the iPad. I was also able to pair this up with my iPhone 8 but not sure I would ever do that in the future. If there would be one suggestion for iPad users who want to use this keyboard, I would buy a case for it if you are going to travel around with it, like me going to campus and putting it in my backpack.

I normally wear these out after about 3 years or so. They can get damaged. My last Apple Keyboard got sat on and one key broke. Replaced it with this one and love it. No more batteries to change, just plug in once a month to charge. They also changed the layout a little. the ip/down/left right keys are much different. The escape key is larger., the upper rim where the battery was is gone. This is the only thing I did not like. It makes picking the keyboard up much harder, If you only leave it on a desk, there is no issue. I set it on my lap while sitting on a couch using the Mac.

I am in the studio all day long working on numerous computers. THIS keyboard is seriously amazing! Specifically for the price! I initially set out to find a keyboard that had more of a laptop feel as the keys *click differently and seem to activate quicker. 90% of my shopping is online, reading reviews such as this so I rarely get to test a product before delivery. With that said...here is what i think:

I LOVE the feel of this! Each key is exactly where it should be. Every key press has a softer click but I wouldn't say is silent. The backside is the brushed metal which gives it the sturdy and professional feel. it is VERY lightweight, but the grips on the back keep it from sliding around on a flat surface. There is no palm rest so I have just pushed the board up a couple inches. Nothing to complain about there. It comes almost fully charged and uses the provided USB cable to recharge. Which I think is AWESOME because there is no reason to buy and replace batteries. It is incredibly responsive and just a joy to work on.

I have purchased MANY keyboards. This replaced the bulky gaming keyboard that was just too much work to use. i prefer the short X keys over the mechanical ones any day!

While this isn't quite the same, it's pretty close. You can use the keyboard while it's recharging (they provided a charging cable). The keyboard is very light and minimal (which I was looking for). I did have issues with the initial keyboard that I received. It seemed like the 'G'  key was less responsive than the other keys, so I reached out to the seller.The seller provided excellent customer service.

VicTsing Keyboard [4.9ft Long Cable][Matte Finish], US Layout wired Computer Keyboard with Foldable Stands, Low Profile Chiclet USB Keyboard Compatible for Windows/PC/Laptop/Desktop/Surface, Black






",$15.59 ,VicTsing,Wired keyboard,Chevas Balloun,No nonsense *wired* keyboard that is surprisingly good for the very low price,"Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2018","I think I am the first real person to review this product. As of writing this review there are six 5-star reviews and each of them are maybe 3-5 words like ""is great, thanks"" ... These reviews appear to be fake / purchased reviews. I saw numerous positive (and real) reviews of this brand of keyboard and mouse combo so I thought that at such a low price, I'll take a risk. I am writing this review on this keyboard.

OVERVIEW:
I have studied, researched, and tested an enormous number of different keyboards (I use a desktop computer all day). Price is no factor with me. I will pay up to $150 for precisely what I want and I have yet to find it. It is amazing to me that a $12.99 keyboard delivers on a lot of my desires. My keyboard of choice has been a Logitech K750 (I have two) and over the last year they both are slow to register key presses, which is a colossal show-stopper. A keyboard must type.

PREFERENCE:
Standard scissor switch / chiclet keyboard

PROS:

**The keys are all where they should be.**
It's surprising to me how many keyboards are out there and the manufacturers want to change something. The function keys are grouped like they should be. The print screen, scroll lock, and pause/break are separate keys that are not bound to insert/home/pageup. Dell keyboards do this which obscures access to print screen, which I use all the time. The enter key is the right size (not the gigantic two rowed kind, but only takes up a single row and the backspace key is larger than a regular letter. There's a full numeric keyboard, etc. etc.

**Key presses register well, even on the edges**
The spacebar is usually the primary test. Will the computer register a spacebar press on the very left or right of the spacebar? Yes it does.

**The distance between the keys is what it should be**
I bought a scissor switch / chiclet razer deathstalker and had to return it because the keys were placed too far from each other. This was interfering with my muscle memory as to where the keys should be.

**Price**
It's right. I will probably buy two more for other machines I have.

CONS
(with consideration of price. ""no back lights"" is not a con because it only cost $13. Let's be reasonable folks)

**Bottom row is unnecessarily taller than the rest of the rows of keys**
A lot of keyboards do this. It is not a show-stopper, but it is not necessary. I prefer standard height for ALL keys.

**Key travel is a bit further than other scissor switch keyboards.**
Other higher quality keyboards are tighter and require less travel. Again, this is acceptable for the price, but it's noticeable. So far, it's not a hindrance for me. It helps that the keys all register well.

**Keys are not seated as tight as I would like**
The Razer Deathstalker had keys that wiggled a LOT. If you place your finger on a key, but don't press it down, then try to wiggle it, you will observe some movement. The Logitech K750 hardly wiggles at all. The keys on the deathstalker wiggled so bad that sometimes they didn't register on key press. The deathstalker had numerous show-stopping flaws, which was sad considering it was ~$100+. This Victsing keyboard has some wiggle on the keys, but it's not as bad. I expected worse for the price. So far, every key press is registering. Perixx makes a wired chiclet keyboard that is more than twice as much as this ~$30 and the keys are tighter. Nevertheless, the Victsing still types well.

OVERALL
This is the best chiclet keyboard you can get for under $20.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$15.59 ,VicTsing,Wired keyboard,Miles Fieldman,"Great budget, low profile keys.","Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2019","Likes:
Low profile keys--I just like them, okay?
No need to install a driver.
It's wired. I don't like wireless input devices.
Its easy to take apart and clean the keys and key wells.
It matches my Victsing mouse pad (okay, that's not an objective like criteria)
The price is great.
It's reliable for what it does.

Dislikes:
Not as quiet as my old logitech, but the wireless logi had other issues...
You might occasionally miss a keystroke, but that is rare if you are doing general typing.
Missing keystrokes, however, is really bad for gaming, and I have missed a few in gaming.
Overall, the keystroke issue isn't horrible. I have seen a lot worse.
I took one star off, when updating this review, for the missed keystrokes and the f and j key markers making it difficult to locate the home keys. It's easy to run your index fingers past them without feeling them.
It is harder to locate the sections of this keyboard, by feel, than other keyboards I have used.
To be fair, other keyboards I've used had many annoying drawbacks that this one lacks.

Conclusion:
While this is not a proper gaming keyboard, it can be used for general computing and gaming without much in the way of issues. Like I said, there is an occasional keystroke missed while getting used to this keyboard's simple characteristics and quirks.

Typing does feel effortless, and I write a lot. I find that my fingers had the tendency to stumble over traditional keyboard keys--which is the main reason I like low profile keys.

So overall, this keyboard deserves a good review. It's comfy, It has served me well for over a year and hasn't died. Add to that, the price is low, which is always good when you are trying to save some money where you can.

It won't be the greatest keyboard you have ever owned, but it is certainly not a bad decision. This is important when you are on a budget and need something to work.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

I've looked into mechanical keyboards, but I tend to prefer flatter keys. My favorite keyboards have always had chiclet keys. Once I started looking around on Amazon, I found that most of the keyboard layouts had something that I didn't care for. After looking for a bit, I ended up deciding this cheap keyboard had the layout I liked best. For $13 there wasn't much of a risk, so I figured I'd go for it.

After trying out the keyboard, I wasn't sure if I liked how I liked the way the keys felt when pressing down on them. After a couple days, however, I've grown to like how typing feels. The keys feel a little more robust than I initial thought. I'm definitely liking the chiclet keys over the generic keyboard keys I had been using. I can type much more quickly without my fingers getting caught on the curved edges of tall keys.

  Keyboard:  This keyboard responded much better than I expected.  If you are already used to this style of keyboard (which is very similar to the keyboard built into my laptop), you will not have any issues with using this keyboard.  The quality of the keyboard materials seems to be very rugged.  It has a very solid construction feel and the rubber feet grip well, so it doesn't slide around.  It doesn't have the feet to allow you to adjust the angle like most keyboards have.  I was surprised to learn that you can use it for gaming as there isn't any lag between key presses and the computer, but due to the shallow and flat key presses, I found it difficult to keep my place on the keyboard while playing fast paced games.  The people complaining about the noise level haven't used a gaming keyboard.  This keyboard is pretty quiet.  If you can handle adding the rubber cover, it's almost silent.  I just couldn't get used to the rubber feel.  If you are using this keyboard in an environment that you have to worry about dust/dirt or liquids, the rubber cover fits the keyboard perfectly.  The keyboard battery life seems really good.  I charged it the day I received it (which you can use it while it charges) and I haven't charged it since.  It's been almost two weeks of daily use at work and it's still going strong.Mouse: Although the mouse works perfectly fine, it does take 2 AAA batteries as apposed to having a rechargeable battery built in like the keyboard.  The build quality of the mouse isn't as nice as the keyboard.  It feels really light, but the scroll wheel and buttons work as expected and it moves pretty smoothly.Final Note: Sleeping.  Because they are wireless, they go to sleep to save power.  The keyboard wakes up immediately, but the mouse seems to need some extra help.  Standard wiggling it around doesn't seem to work.  Maybe I'm impatient (Yeah.. I am), but picking the mouse up and tapping it on the desk a few times wakes it right up.  Not sure how long it will last being abused like this, but I haven't broke it yet.

  This is an awesome setup. I have been having issues with my previous Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse for some time, just age and wear from constant use for several years. This one is nice to have. I Wish I had replaced this a year ago. Keyboard is well made and when you update the Vive Comb software you can easily set the function keys to open the apps you want open each morning. Also you can set them so you don't have to press the function key to activate those functions (Be cautious around the sleep/moon button!). High-End Scissor Switch design provides a better tactile response and comfortable and whisper quiet typing experience. The mouse is much more sturdy and well made than the other model and has buttons on the side for forward and back in the browser.  The Built-in rechargeable battery supports 35-hour continuous working / standby 30 days and only takes 2 hours to get the keyboard fully charged. It can automatically enter into sleep mode in order to save energy. The full size keyboard includes fast-access hot keys, versatile function keys and number pad which can improve you work efficiency.  I have the button in the wheel set to open file explorer which I use often. Can't beat this setup for the money. Thank you Vive Comb.

  So i bought this to use with my T440p Thinkpad while docked, running linux and it works great! Both the keyboard and mouse are little flatter than i would would prefer, but that doesn't make it uncomfortable. I feel the keys have the perfect amount of spacing for my large hands, where mistyping is not an issue. The key travel is just fine too, and the key press is just firm enough enough where if i do mistype, i probably wont have to back space. While not nearly as silent as some reviews have said, I do find the keys have a satisfying clickety clack to them. The mouse kind of surprised me too, I didn't think i would like it due to it's flat nature, but it wasn't uncomfortable to use, it's very lite, and the buttons have a nice silent but bassy click sound to them. I spent 2 whole days, 8 hours each, doing online courses and projects where the peripherals were not a hindrance, and in fact improved my work flow over my gaming mechanical keyboard where spacing and sensitivity are a HUGE issue. Overall, I love this combo!

  I bought this for home and gaming but loved it so much that i bought it for the office to. The thing i love most about this keyboard is that you can lock the function keys to one or the other. At the office i need to use the F keys a lot so i lock the shift keys to use them. At home I use the volume and multimedia keys more. that's something i can't even do on my laptop keys so it's pretty awesome. some games use the f keys as well so it's handy to be able to switch between the uses.The battery life isnt great but it's not bad. At the office it last about a week and i just pug it in on fridays. At home it lasts a couple weeks between . but both can be charged back up with a usb cable. The mouse in both situations has not died yet at all, just the keyboard.

  This RGB keyboard has been a lifesaver as someone who spends a lot of time typing documents this keyboard is very easy to use. I love how soft the keys feel. Having the ten key on the left side is very functional. I use the keyboard for work, my homework for college and online gaming and it is perfect for everything. The cord is long enough to have plenty of room to move the keyboard where you want it but it does not get tangled up. At the very top of the keyboard there is a place to hold your cellphone. How cool is that?! The lights are a really neat feature; my whole computer set up is RGB so this just made my set up look even better. One of my favorite things about the keyboard is that the sound of the keys is really not loud at all. Every other keyboard I have owned has sounded much louder than this keyboard. Also, after a few minutes of not being used the keyboard turns the light off. To me that was a great feature because it means you don’t have to have the lights on the keyboard on all the time. The keyboard came with instructions manual on how to customize the light display. The keyboard looks and feels very expensive, in fact I had been looking at a gaming keyboard almost identical to this one and it was much more expensive and the keys didn’t feel as soft as this keyboard. I am very picky about little things when I buy something but this keyboard is fantastic, I love it and I would recommend this keyboard over the expensive brand. You will really get much more bang for your buck. This keyboard is perfect for anyone, if you want an office computer just turn the lights off or if you or your kid is a gamer this is great for gaming as well. I really cannot brag enough about how much I love this keyboard. The bang for the buck is there. the keys don't feel squishy, and in FPS gaming, it's a perfect feel. That RGB backlight gives it a perfect bling. I kinda wish the cell holder was a tad bigger, since I have a bulky case on my Note9, but that's a small complaint. it's hard to really find anything wrong, It’s a great keyboard, the build quality really makes it feel like it is a high dollar model. it really fits the rainbow unicorn aesthetic of my build too. I'm doing my best to find a gripe, and I can't. I recommend it if you want something cool, flashy, and super functional on a budget. gonna order a second one for my kid, we game together.

",$26.99 ,VicTsing,Gaming,Yash Sawant,Good Quality Gaming Keyboard. Definitely Value for money !!!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2020","Personally speaking, I started liking this keyboard and I’m happy I got this gaming version. I have seen many reviews about this product but in my opinion, it’s not at all bad.

Due to this COVID-19 situation, long back our office asked us to work from home using Citrix. Only due to this reason I started working from home, so I wanted to prepare the workstation kind of setup.

So just to set up everything at home, I decided to buy Monitor, Keyboard & Docking Station. Initially, I was a little hesitant because this was a gaming keyboard and I haven’t used it before any of them.

Currently, there are so many types of Keyboard that are in the market which will definitely confuse you (Also some expensive gaming keyboards too, I mean really 100$ to 200$ keyboard). My budget was not that high, as I already prepared the entire setup for Home Working Station.

This mechanical keyboard is a little heavier than the normal keyboard (Don’t get me wrong mechanical gaming keyboards always heavier than normal ones). This metal body gives the keyboard a nice heavyweight and sturdy premium feel. The quality construction is consistent in all aspects including body, Keys, etc. It also has a built-in mobile stand.

It also has multiple LED light features, which you can use depend on your choice or you can completely turn off to use like a normal keyboard. (Please ref my images),

I strongly recommend for anyone looking for a keyboard is not expensive but fast and mechanical. (Value for money)

  This keyboard was a steal---totally functional and absolutely budget friendly. The lighting was good, not the best I've seen but I'm simple and easy to please. The metal casing was a big plus that made it feel sturdy and I did like that it also functioned as a phone stand. The keys clacked like they should, but in comparison to how the keys on my backup Dell keyboard feel, the VictSing's felt a little cheaper. The biggest downfall for me was after a few weeks of use, while playing the Sims 3, the left CTRL key stopped working. My VictSing keyboard did not come with a paper manual so I wasn't sure if I accidentally did a combo click that changed the settings (switching back and forth between a Mac Keyboard for work and PC for home). It seemed to be common enough of an occurrence in general since Google showed many results of other people having that same issue. I was troubleshooting possibilities and that was when I discovered that the 'P' and 'K' keys also weren't functioning (couldn't type out keyboard in my search). Other keyboards plugged into my PC work fine so it wasn't an issue with my PC or the drivers for the keyboard, as I tested it on another computer and the same three keys still did not work.Overall, not sure what the issue was so I'm giving this an overall rating of 2 stars since for many it seems to work fine but for unfortunate folk like me, it did not.

Magic Keyboard for 12.9-inch iPad Pro (4th Generation) - US English






",$329.98 ,Apple,,David W.,"A premium, worthwhile product, but do your research.","Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2020","I'm puzzled by some of the negative reviews on here. You should know, before buying this, that there are no function keys, that it is heavy, and that it can be awkward to open in the usual way. Reports of excessive battery drain by the case are sporadic enough that I feel like they have to be the exception, not the rule; I've had no issues with this myself.
Regarding the keyboard, I will compare this to the keys on the smart keyboard folio, a mid-2012 Macbook Air, and the bluetooth Magic Keyboard (second generation) from Apple, the latter two which also use the scissor switch mechanism. I had previously owned the folio keyboard, and enjoyed typing on it, but, no question, this keyboard feels far far superior, and I find myself able to type much faster and more accurately on it. As for the other two, you can definitely feel the difference in the redesigned scissor keys - the keys on my 2012 Air are fine, but slightly mushier compared to this; in contrast, the bluetooth Magic Keyboard's keys feel somehow sharper and more clackity compared to the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard. I think I like this keyboard slightly better.
Where the scales tip, though, is the integration of the trackpad with the keyboard. With the folio, you'd have to interact with the screen directly for anything that couldn't be done using hotkeys (even if you remap the globe key as the Escape key, there are some limitations). But having a quick way to scroll, navigate the screen, and engage the usual swipe gestures right there by the keyboard eliminates most of these issues. So nice.
Regarding the function keys, yes, it'd be nice if they were there, but it's not the issue some are making it out to be. The Escape key can be mapped to the globe key; the only other ones I really miss are volume and brightness control, and, using the trackpad, it's quite easy to click on the battery percentage indicator at the top right of the screen, which drops down the control center for easy adjustment of either setting. Not perfect, but more than good enough.
Finally, the passthrough charging. I hadn't thought I'd care much about this, since I'm not using the side-port for anything now; what I hadn't considered was how this feature effectively gives the iPad a sort of wireless charging; leaving the keyboard case open and plugged in on the desk, I take the iPad off when I want to use it in tablet mode, and then just pop it back on when I'm done, and it's instantly charging.
A few cons: I found that this keyboard isn't as enjoyable to use in the lap, compared to the smart folio; something about the number of moving parts makes it feel more shaky/less stable to type on, and the weight distribution is such that it wants to lean backwards when it's not on a stable foundation. That said, on a desk, it is superb.
Also, when I first started using it, I ran into the issue of occasionally hitting my fingers against the bottom of the iPad while typing (especially when reaching for keys on the number row); I've gotten used to it now, but, some might find this annoying.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I am a writer/teacher. I love being able to take my work with me to wherever the mood strikes. My latest mood has me sitting outside in the evening, undistracted and surrounded by chirps and frogs to help set the mood for writing. Unfortunately, I have been forced to either drag along my MacBook Pro or set up some funky lighting so I can see the keys on my previous magic keyboard (not backlit) to use my iPad Pro 12.9.This looked like a viable solution, so I ordered it. After a phone chat with the Apple support rep to discover I needed to update my iOS version, everything plugged in and ran like it was supposed to.Now, I have a backlit keyboard—but that’s just the start. I am thrilled with the key response, the quietness, and now I am becoming a huge fan of the scroll pad that I never thought I needed.  Ice the cake with the multitouch gestures on the trackpad. This is a serious tool and a very cool gift to myself during this Shelter-in-place due to the pandemic. Buy one. It is the best accessories I have ever owned (so far, heehee).

  This keyboard with trackpad is perfect. The design is perfect.  It is incredibly steady considering its in a hovering position. The keyboard is backlit, (finally!!!!).  The feedback from the keys is perfect, a very smooth type. The trackpad responds perfectly to tap and click to select. It’s operation is flawless from the hardware side though apple has some work to do on iPad OS before it is practical to use without touching the screen at all. The weight is perfect. It feels very sturdy but not too heavy.  Any lighter would be too flimsy. It sits nicely in your lap or on the armrest of couch/chair.  The ability to change the angle of the display is nice and gives more viewing options than one may think.  The ability to charge through the case allows you to use the iPads USB-C port for an accessory and charge the iPad at the same time (for those complaining about the price the RELIABLE accessories that available for musicians to get an extra port so they can plug in their instrument and charge their iPad at the same time are over $100 by themselves, then with the addition of the track and sturdier build it’s not a bad price).  The iPad does not hover over any keys making typing an issue as many speculated it would.  My only complaint is that there is still no Escape key.

  This is a great keyboard.  I've owned many mechanical keyboards, mainly with Cherry MX Brown switches, and needed something quieter due to a high percentage of my day on conference calls.  Purchased this HyperX alloy Core RGB keyboard on a Prime day 2019 sale, and am very pleased with it.PROS:  -Solid construction - will not move on your desk, will only flex if you except an unnatural amount of force in the center  -Legible keycaps - easy to read, no 'gamer' font  -LED lighting - bright and can customize for the five zones  -Warranty - the real deal breaker for me with some of the no-name Chinese brands on Amazon.  Two year warranty by a company with a customer service department you can contact  -Tactile - I would compare the tactility of this membrane keyboard to Cherry Brown switches.  They are better than the knockoff Cherry brown switches I've had from no-name Chinese keyboards.  -Quiet - This keyboard is very quiet.  No keycap jittering noise, no noise when the key bottoms out, no noise when it returns up  -No software - you don't need, nor is it available to manage this keyboard's settings with software.  You simply use the function keys to set all lighting and Windows key lock (ie: game mode)  -Braided cable - not really important, but is a nice touch that doesn't feel cheap  -Media keys - great feature that other keyboards in this price range don't includeCONS:  -Keycap material -  ABS, not PBT - will accumulate oils from typing - but easily cleaned with an occasional wipe down.  Expected at this pricepoint.  -Caps Lock, Num Lock, Game lock indicators are not easily identifiable - would have been better to have a lighted icon than a white led with hard to read embossed text

I've used junk Dell oems that did, so a nicer upgraded one certainly should.  One small gripe on this keyboard is the top buttons for media and board control are NOT lighted, also the ""HyperX"" logo isn't lighted, and these items SHOULD be lighted on a board of this quality. $50 is less than many keyboards, but still isn't what I'd call ""cheap"".

  Straight out of the box this keyboard looks impressive. The fact that it lights up is probably why most people will buy it, and that is indeed impressive in its own right, but even before it lights up it looks way cooler than any standard keyboard. The metallic backboard is really shiny and the key surfaces are soft to the touch with kind of a cool futuristic font, so even before you plug in the usb cord and see it light up it's great.  The main reason I was interested in this is because my current keyboard does not have any sort of backlighting, at all. I like to keep my living room relatively dim in the evening, just candles when possible, but I can't do that and type too. This keyboard solved that! I'm currently sitting in the dark but now I have an awesome colorful backlit glow that allows me to type in here too! As I've been using this over the last day or so, I've noticed two things.  1. I wish I had this at my office, because my nails always make a loud click-clack sound on my keyboard and it drives my co-workers crazy, but this keyboard is a little softer to the touch and therefore much quieter to the ear, and 2. The space key has a couple springs in it, and you can hear the springs vibrate slightly right after you touch it, every time you touch it (which is way more than you realize, once you can hear it every time). Within a minute or two I forgot all about it, but it is loud enough to be noticeable until you get used to it.  I think this would be an especially cool gift for anyone who uses their keyboard in the dark; it looks great, works great, and seems durable/well made.

The board is very quiet. I had an old Dell keyboard (which had millions of cells of DNA in it and made me want to throw up) that I replaced. That board was very loud when I typed. This thing is much quieter. So if you're on the phone with somebody that's putting you to sleep with their story, they MIGHT not know you are typing the whole time. But this is not a SILENT keyboard.

I do wonder how the keys will look long term. The keys appear to be prone to the letter flaking over time. But that's just a hunch, based on the architecture and look of the keys. We will see. In all, a solid keyboard for $28.

If you think the rainbow lights on the keyboard don't appeal to you, it's easy to dim the lights or shut them off entirely. Just press ""Fn,"" then ""page up"" (to brighten) or ""page down"" to dim.

HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2






",$53.97 ,HP,,Craig,Feels Great to Use -- Only Works About Six Months (I've had 5),"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2018","This keyboard feels amazing. it's the best feeling keyboad I've ever used. I am a web developer and web host and spend about 10-12 hours a day at my desk. I wouldn't use any other keyboard.

Now the bad news, and the reason for the three stars. It only last about six months. Around six-seven month mark, every time, it starts not working as well. You'll hit keys and it won't type, you'll enter passwords that have caps in them, you'll be holding down shift but it's not working so you're not typing in caps. It's a real pain. If you smash it pretty good, it'll work for another 30 minutes or so, but eventually the smashing, I am sure, begins to take over whatever contact issue these things have.

I've owned about 8 over the years.

For the price, I've opted to replace every six months. And it's not the batteries, I'm not an idiot. Every time it starts doing it i'll put fresh batteries in hoping that's it this time... but it's not. I try to reset it too.

HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2






",$53.97 ,HP,,Scott Preston,Best Keyboard I've Ever Used...,"Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2013","I work in IT for KeyBank so I've used a lot of keyboards, and this keyboard is fantastic. I now own three of them -- one for my daughter's PC, one for my main home PC, and one for my wife and my work laptops when we work remote. My wife bought a low-end Logitech keyboard because it was cheap, and quickly returned it and had me buy another one of these. Everyone in this house loves them. They are incredibly responsive, very sleek, and very easy to use.

The most important pros include:

They are completely compatible in Windows 7 & 8.
Not only are they compatible, but no configuration is even required. This includes the sleep, volume, web, and special function (Fn) buttons. I especially enjoy the new Windows 8 function button options painted on the Fn keys.

Comfortable feel.
All the keys are properly placed exactly where I expect them to be without having to hunt the keyboard. The keys also have very little travel to depress them. This is very convenient if you are a skilled typist. The keys also have a very nice tactile feedback that really let's you know you've hit the key.

Very long battery life.
While I have had to replace the batteries a few times a year, I change the batteries on these keyboards about once every couple years. There is also a tiny low battery indicator on the keyboard which is helpful.

Very durable.
Even the earliest one of these that I bought hasn't lost any of the paint off any of the keys after three years of use. They have taken a lot of use and abuse and still work like new.

Shallow sealed key design.
These keyboards are very easy to clean. Dirt doesn't really have a place to nest or get under the keys like on many other keyboards I've used.

Link-5.
I can use a single dongle in one USB port and it controls the mouse(mice) and keyboard(s). It controls up to five devices which is great if you have limited USB ports. This is becoming standard, but I'll still give it a spot on the pro list.

Sharp look and slim design.
It just looks good sitting on any desk. It's also very slim so it's easy to manipulate. I have an HP TouchSmart PC, and it easily slides under it if I need extra desk space. I'm not a fan of bulky design, ergonomics, or wrist rests. Just give me a nice keyboard.

The cons include:

F, J, and 5 button indicators.
This is the only real con I can find with this keyboard. The little F, J, and 5 indicator bump on the keys that you need for proper finger placement are there, but they could be a little more pronounced. The last HP keyboard I owned was slightly more pronounced which made the keys easy to find. I'm getting used to it, but I find I have to rub around the keys a little to confirm I have the right keys. If you're a hunt-and-pecker, it won't matter, but if you're a touch typist, it will take some getting used to.

In closing:
I highly recommend this keyboard to anyone that wants an excellent, comfortable, and durable keyboard. It will last for years and you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$53.97 ,HP,,Coffee4matt,Battery Life is now down to less than ONE WEEK....!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 31, 2018","First let me say I am on my 2nd HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2. I loved the first one so much I literally wore the white ink off of 3 or 4 keys, never had any problems, and I just LOVE the form factor of this keyboard. I replaced it after about 2-3 years w/ the same model new keyboard, just to get the white letters back, after the little post-it replacement letters kept falling off.

I've had my 2nd keyboard for 15 months now, and it worked flawlessly for ~ 9 months. But for the past ~ 6 months, I literally have to replace the 2 AAA batteries ~ every 5-6 days at this point - worse than my Arlo security cameras!!! (I put a post-it log on the back to log the battery change dates! When this frst started happening I would get 7-10 days out of my batteries (can't remember how long they originally lasted, at least a few months, which I would be DELIGHTED with today!), but for the last month they are now down to 5-6 days! I just changed them 5 minutes ago (on 5/31) after my last new set on 5/25/18. I keep big ziplock bag full of fresh batteries next to my PC and a DC Volt meter to make sure I'm not imagining things...sure enough, the fresh batteries always start at ~ ""1.58 - 1.59 volts"", and in less than a week are down to ~ ""1.29 - 1.35"" volts.

I buy CVS Alkaline batteries very inexpensively with a coupon (or Duracell Energizer alkalines at Costco in bulk), which is why I put up w/ this for almost 6 mos now, but now I'm done! Even more than the $$, I just hate having to stop & change them!

Loved the keyboard so much, if I can justify the ~ $35 cost as a ""disposable"" purchase (like batteries!) for ~ 9 months of use, I will buy a new one again. HP, if you are listening and want me to ship you this keyboard, so you can test it and declare I just got a rare ""bad one"", just pay for shipping and it's all yours! (I suspect I just got a bad unit, since I never had this problem with the first keyboard. Hey, I'm ""batting 0.500"" on these keyboards...in baseball that would be a GREAT stat! Should I get a 3rd one and try to raise my bating average to 0.667 ?!)

If I buy a new one and the batteries stay fresh over a year, I will be back to change this post to 5 stars, cheerfully! Except for the battery issue, IMO it's the best keyboard out there.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I have thoroughly tested this keyboard and have come to the sincere conclusion that there is simply no better keyboard to be found for the Mac—anywhere. I have owned multiple Macs since they were introduced in 1984. I have tried dozens of keyboards through the years, Logitech, Kensington, everything Apple has produced, etc. Nothing can compare to the ease of use, amazing functionality, aesthetic elegance, and compelling ergonomic design of this keyboard by Jelly Comb.

Advertising is notoriously misleading in the marketplace, but this product not only accurately mirrors its marketing spiel but also exceeds every claim in functionality. The wireless, Bluetooth connectivity is instantaneous, robust, and completely stable. With the press of any of three well-marked keys, I can alternate typing on my Mac, my iPhone, or my iPad—from the same keyboard. I often keep these three devices set before me and make full use of them as I work. All I can say is that you will not go wrong with this keyboard.

You have to mush it just a little bit further/harder than it takes to feel a response, which must be why when I'm really typing fast, certain letters just don't show up.

There's no way I'm buying another Apple keyboard for what it cost and how short it was before it broke, but I was hoping to get something that had keys and dimensions that were similar. It looks like it's close enough, for me, especially given the price.

Since I'm using it with a Mac, I had to change the modifier keys, especially since there'd be only one 'windows key' to assign as being a 'command key.' And it looks like even the cheaper keyboards all now have dedicated keys for vol up & down, and the F12 key works to open/close the optical drive.

Despite being plastic, this keyboard doesn't have a cheap feel, at least not to me. I like the action of the keys. My only complaint is probably something that a non-Apple/non-Mac user wouldn't probably know about - there's no USB ports at the ends of the keyboard. Apple's been making keyboards with the ports at the end since even prior to USB. With a 'tower' style computer and a corded mouse, those ports are really a necessity.

...So, my only real complaint is no USB ports on the keyboard itself. At this price, I wouldn't knock off a star usually, but I know that Logitech makes this keyboard, and they got everything else right.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Redragon K502 RGB Gaming Keyboard RGB LED Backlit Illuminated 104 Key Silent Keyboard with Wrist Rest for Windows PC Games (RGB Backlit)






",$28.99 ,Redragon,Multimedia,Harte,"GREAT Quality - If You're on a Budget, GO FOR IT!","Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2016","FIRST IMPRESSION:
So I received this in the mail an hour ago, and I'm giving you guys my first impression of the keyboard, not after days or weeks or months of use.

- The keys are a little mushy and I feel like I'm not typing nearly as fast as I usually can because I have to use more effort to hit the keys. The traveling distance is about 3-4 millimeters, which may be slightly more than what you're used to as well.
- The keys and the Redragon logo have little LED lights underneath them, but they aren't very bright. I prefer to keep the lights off.
- This keyboard is extremely quiet. I wouldn't say it's silent, but it's definitely a lot quieter than most rubber dome keyboards. Depending on the kind of desk you have, putting a rubber mat (like a mouse pad) underneath the keyboard will make your typing a lot quieter than when the keyboard is directly on your desk.
- The keys are removable, but they aren't really easy to pry off. Use a flathead screwdriver and a gentle hand.
- The wrist rest is pretty comfortable, but I feel like I would be more comfortable typing if my hands were elevated a little more. I'm also a little worried about the matte finish rubbing away over time.
EDIT: The matte finish on the wrist rest hasn't worn off even after over a year of use. You probably don't have to worry.
- The keyboard is lightweight, but when placed on my desk it has a relatively sturdy feel to it and doesn't bend. It does move around very slightly.
- The kickstands underneath the keyboard raise it up about 3/4 of an inch. They have a plastic bottom instead of rubber, so it's possible that this may allow it to move a little bit.
EDIT: The kickstands are also somewhat flimsy, and one of mine has broken off... :'(
- The braided cord is about 6 feet long and feels extremely durable, which is great if you're rough on your cables, I guess. The USB is white and gold-plated, so it seems to be a 1.0. It works with my black 2.0, blue 3.0 and red 3.1 USB ports. If your keyboard doesn't work in any of your USB ports, then your keyboard is defective.

Someone wrote a review saying that when they received it, the 'Enter' key was sticking outside of the box. Now I'm not entirely sure what they mean by that, but when I received it all of the keys were perfectly intact.

A few tricks you should know before assuming your keyboard is defective:
• The 'lightbulb' key switches the color of the LED lights.
• FN+'lightbulb' activates breathing lights
• FN+- slows down breathing
• FN+= speeds up breathing
• FN+Pg-Up turns up the brightness of the LEDs
• FN+Pg-Down dims the LEDs
• FN+Win activates Win Lock
• FN+W swaps WASD and arrow keys

WHAT I RECOMMEND:
Use this keyboard with an extended gaming mouse pad underneath it. Not only will it minimize the sound, but it'll also eliminate the chances of it moving around. You can get one for about $10 if you don't already have one.

---

UPDATE 7/9/2016 :
It's been a few weeks since I purchased this, so I thought I'd update my review with a few of my observations.

- So far, the matte material is showing no signs of wear whatsoever. The surface is insanely easy to clean (I just use a slightly damp cloth). You can take off the keys if you're very careful, but it's not easy at all.
- It's a lot easier for me to type on it now than it was when I first got it. I'm up to my normal typing speed now, so the keys, however, a little soft, aren't holding me back... so don't let that scare you.
- The response time is absolutely impeccable, so if you're a fast typer or a gamer with a budget, you can count on this keyboard.
- At the moment, after a few weeks of use, this is definitely one of the BEST KEYBOARDS you can get for this price.

-

UPDATE 7/29/2017 :

It's been over a year since I bought this keyboard. The mechanics are showing no signs of wear, but some of the matte finish has begun to wear off on 3 different keys (A, S, & D.... can you tell I'm a gamer?).When the black paint wears away on the keys, there is just clear plastic underneath. However, the matte finish hasn't rubbed away on the surrounding plastic or on the wrist rest itself, even though I've been using this keyboard often and for over a year.
If you're worried about what I said about the mushy keys and longer travelling distance, don't be. It's definitely something that you get used to over time, but it shouldn't affect anything you do too drastically. As it can be when getting any new keyboard, there is a bit of a learning curve.

Changed my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. Durable and high quality :)

-

UPDATE 10/20/2018:

I don't know why I keep updating this, but it's still working. This keyboard has seen some crap but it's not showing any signs of mechanical wear after over 2 years of daily use. How much was this again? So worth it. I'm so impressed that it's still working because I feel like you never know with buying electronics online...

- Supergreat price
- The green LED is superb, v v ince
- Keys are essentially silent, would recommend for ninjas
- All keys function, including media/F keys
- There's a dragon on it that lights up how cool is that?? Answer: SUPREMELY
- Cord is braided, allowing for neat look and texture, as well as friction-free movement across wood, corners of desk, etc. [now if only my Anker ergonomic mouse was the same way]
- THERE'S A GOT-DANG CALCULATOR BUTTON, WHO THOUGHT OF THAT?? TAKE THAT, STATS HOMEWORK!

Meh:
- Enter key takes a bit to get used to
- Typing in general is a bit odd because rubber keys, but ya get used to it
- Spacebar doesn't always feel like it's being keyed
- 'Off' is one of the brightness levels, though the highest level is perfect imo
- Caps/Num/Win Lock lights are red and can't be modified in any way - in a way that's kindof a plus though, since you can see what's locked and what isn't without having to actual look at that sector of the keyboard. So I guess this line is superfluous

Cons:

Redragon K502 RGB Gaming Keyboard RGB LED Backlit Illuminated 104 Key Silent Keyboard with Wrist Rest for Windows PC Games (RGB Backlit)






",$28.99 ,Redragon,Multimedia,Kinh Williams,"Affordable, solid, nice look & feel keyboard, but inconsistently stiff keys","Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2018","
  I purchased this keyboard as a cheaper alternative to the ""Razer DeathStalker Essential Gaming Keyboard"" (they seem very similar in looks with its low profile, chiclet style keys) . I like the variable backlight colors and it actually feels sturdy with minimal flex which was a pleasant surprise for a keyboard at this price! I can use it on my lap when gaming out in the living room and works quite well for first person shooters. Braided cable is a nice touch. Awesome.  However!! ...there's always a catch, isn't there.The keys are stiff - it takes considerable more pressure to actuate the keys than what I'm used to.  Now that's something you can eventually adapt to - the problem is, some keys, especially the horizontally longer keys to the right of the keyboard, such as the 'backspace', need more pressure than others, especially if you press the key off-angle and not right in the center (perhaps a little bit of binding is at play).  So while touch typing, this can be aggravating when a key press didn't register because you didn't press it hard enough despite using the same pressure as the other keys.So in conclusion, great for FPS gaming (where your hand is over the WASD, shift and spacebar) but not so much when you're typing away.  I still think it's an overall decent value given the low price, but it could be a 5 star product if it weren't for that inconsistency. I've noticed other reviews have noted similar issues so just add me to that list.Update: The backspace started to become more and more problematic with its binding, sometimes not working even after pressing it again, harder!  Returning this to Amazon and lowering it to 2 stars vs 3.

",$99.99 ,Gaming,,Egor,This keyboard lives up to the hype.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2019","The review is about the Apex Pro Keyboard, NOT Apex 7.

Adjusting the actuation is great! I can feel the difference in games with their super fast actuation. Typing is just the reverse though, I have a lot of typos with the super fast actuation. Which isn't a problem at all, because you can switch profiles on the fly and have one of the best typing experiences imaginable with super deep 3.6 mm actuation point. It's like having multiple keyboards at once, and being able to change them effortlessly to suit the task at hand.

Some disadvantages I'd like to point out:
- Not waterproof. Be careful with it.
- Only the main block uses omnipoint switches. Not a big issue considering you don't really use the other keys, but that's a good reason to make a 60% or TKL Keyboard with only omnipoint switches, no? After using TKL keyboards I've really appreciate the extra space. I highly recommend the TKL version over the full one, once it actually releases.
- O-rings will prevent the 3.6mm actuation point from working properly, and I really didn't like how O-rings felt on this keyboard. Not really an issue considering that the keyboard is already quite silent even without any O-rings.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$99.99 ,Gaming,,Mazin Recine,Great Keyboard with Cool Features,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2019","
  I have owned a Steelseries keyboard in the past and was greatly disappointed with the switches it used. I had a m750 with the qx2 switches, and they just felt off to me. Not really sure how to explain, but they just felt off. Im not generally a fan of linear switches ( as a gamer, blasphemy I know) as I tend to have a heavy hand and accidentally hold shift  or ctrl by accident, which messes up my movement and gets me killed. Not only that but I feel I mess up more when typing essays for college and have to go back to revise more frequently. I needed a new keyboard that would allow more space for my mouse, as I play on a low dpi, and was looking at TKL models from various companies. Originally I was planning on the G Pro from Logitech to go with my G Pro Wireless, but then I realized they had Romer-G switches. I tested them out and found them alright, but lack of customization and after market keycaps was a turn off for me. The new Apex Pro TKL came out with their OmniPoint switches, which are linear switches that you could change the actuation point of to fit your preference. Again, I am not a fan of linear, so this disappointed me as the rest of the keyboard caught my attention. Luckily with the Apex 7 they allow you to choose your switches out of the 3 options they provide. I chose the browns as I wanted something fast but with some feedback. When it arrived 2 days later, I was impressed with the size and beauty of it. The nicest keyboard I owned so far. The switches feel nice, and there are a few features you won’t find on a some other TKL keyboards like the OLED display (mostly a gimmick but cool nonetheless), usb passthrough, cable routing, and dial. The magnetic wrist rest isn’t plush, more like a flat rubber surface to prop up your hand. That isn’t to say it’s not comfortable or soft, but it is a pain to clean as it is a dust magnet. They keycaps feel cheap and are my main gripe for a premium keyboard, however I Luckily had higher quality shine-through keycaps from previously. Overall I am satisfied with the keyboard and would recommend to anyone thinking of purchasing.

I've been gaming since I was his age, build my own PC's with quality components and usually go with the high end keyboards, but I would actually use this keyboard myself.  I especially like how it is plug and play so I didn't have to install any software to change the colors patterns (He says there are at least 9 color schemes).

While this doesn't feel exactly like those it is very nice to type on with OUTEMU blue switches. These are very loud and clicky so if you don't like that or live with someone who is sensitive to the sound of loud typing you may want to research different key switch types though I enjoy the tactile sensation of the activated keys clicking.

One of the main selling points for me was also the double-shot keycaps which means the letters will not wear off as they are molded in clear plastic inside of a black plastic cap. The font is a little cheesy but readable and functional.

The LEDs are one color and cannot be changed but there are 9 pre-set lighting arrangements and no extra software needs to be installed. The overall build quality is surprisingly good with a heavy backing and rubber on the stand feet holding it firmly in place on your desk.

I upgraded to this bluetooth keyboard which connected seamlessly via bluetooth. This was a new item and had no reviews, so I was taking a risk but it paid off, I love the keyboard!  It feels very sturdy, high quality materials. The keys have a nice tactile feel . It connects to multiple devices which is nice.  The full-size number pad is great, and somehow they managed to pack all that into a fairly small design without making the keyboard feel small. The only drawback is that this keyboard is meant to be compatible with both Mac and PC, which means it has both a ""Command"" key for Mac and ""Atl"" key for PC. Since I only need the command key I wish it was a little larger, but it's a minor issue that I have adapted to pretty quickly. Only other thing to mention is that the keyboard will go into low power mode to save battery, so when you start typing after leaving it a while just hit a key to wake it up first, otherwise you might lose the first letter you type. Again easy to adapt to. So far battery  seems great, only charged it once when I first took it out of box and been using it several hours/day for over a week. Very happy.

  I use this keyboard for business where I construct a lot of spreadsheets.  I use both a Mac and a PC.  This one device connects with both as well as my phone seamlessly and at the same time, once paired.  Pairing is easy and switching is only a matter of pressing 1 key.  The other salient point is the width.  I do not like the extra wide keyboards taking up space on my desktop.  This keyboard is only 14"" wide with a full number key pad, perfect!  The keys are smooth and responsive, no lag time via bluetooth and what is really fantastic is that there is not a dongle saving a USB port for other devices.

Razer Huntsman Gaming Keyboard: Fastest Keyboard Switches Ever - Clicky Optical Switches - Customizable Chroma RGB Lighting - Programmable Macro Functionality - Classic Black






",$89.99 ,,,Calipark,Watch out for misleading marketing,"Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2019","So far this keyboard has been fine. Definitely not worth the $120 USD I paid though. The reason I'm giving this 1 star is for the flagrant misleading marketing and product information concerning the on-board memory feature.

Flat out, you cannot store lighting profiles on the keyboard's memory as they lead you to believe. If you are on a Mac or a PC without the spyware ridden Razer Synapse 3 software you are stuck with the distracting default color cycling lighting effect.

You can't even choose to set a static color. A Razer engineer who worked on this keyboard posted on Razer's support forums and claimed they cut on-board lighting storage due vague complications with RAM use under complex lighting profiles and compatibility with older keyboards. I can understand hardware limitations but the compatibility claims are weak. In the engineers own words, the on-board storage only extends to the macro feature. Which most people won't use anyways.

Still, the marketing clearly leads you to believe your entire profile would be stored in the on-board memory. Quoted from this very store page ""HYBRID ON-BOARD MEMORY AND CLOUD STORAGE: Access personalized settings anywhere"".

Let's be real here. This is an issue that won't affect the majority of users. I'm sure most of you are perfectly fine with having the Synapse software installed and being forced to make an account (all while giving your personal info to Razer). But those of use who just want simple static lighting or very basic lighting features are out of luck.

It's a $120 keyboard. Razer can do better than this. You can buy better than this for less money from a company with less of a history of misleading their costumers.

If Razer fixes this issue, I'll update this review. But I'm not holding my breath.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Razer Huntsman Gaming Keyboard: Fastest Keyboard Switches Ever - Clicky Optical Switches - Customizable Chroma RGB Lighting - Programmable Macro Functionality - Classic Black






",$89.99 ,,,kunoh,"Despite loud keys, excellent gaming and typing experience; can replace keycaps","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2018","I really like the feel of this keyboard. Typing and gaming feels great, and the over all build of this keyboard is top-notch. Be warned though - like many mechanical keyboards, typing on this keyboard can be loud. So I wouldn't recommend this for office use. But for my home use, it's perfect. I even managed to replace the keycaps with that of another brand.

Performance:
During long gaming sessions, I found that the keys felt more comfortable than other keyboards I've used in the past. I think the reason for this is that I don't actually have to press as hard for the keys to register. Razer states that the keys on the Huntsman require slightly less force and register quicker than other keyboards. All I can say is that this keyboard feels ""broken-in"" for lack of a better term. It just feels good, and ""fast."" Additionally, the keyboard has 4 media buttons and a moveable dial (one of the 4 buttons is the dial itself - as it can be pushed in, in addition to being rotated) - all of which can be remapped to your liking. By default, they were set to control music playback - in my case, it controls Spotify. I never really planned on using these media controls, but now that I have them - I can never go back. It's great when I'm playing a game with my own music running, but also being able to pause that music should a cutscene in the game start to play - all by pressing a button.

Lack of Macro keys and USB ports:
Unfortunately, the Razer Huntsman does not have macro keys like other keyboards in its price range (Corsair's K95 does have them). Understandably, this would have been nice to have for some users. (Personally I never used macro keys much myself when I had keyboards that did have them.) Also present on other expensive keyboards is a USB passthrough port. Again, the Huntsman lacks this as well.

Loud keys:
As stated before, most mechanical keyboards are ""loud"" and can annoy people who maybe sitting relatively close to you. If you are in an office situation, I would recommend using a different keyboard that has ""quiet"" mechanical keys like Cherry Browns on a Corsair keyboard; or Razer Orange keys on the Razer Blackwidow. Unfortunately, Razer does not offer a more ""quiet"" version of the Huntsman Elite at this time.

Lighting:
The keys on the Huntsman are quite bright, even when compared to Razer's other offerings like the Ornata Chroma. The difference here is that while the letters on the keys of the Huntsman are significantly brighter; the Ornata Chroma's underlying membrane is also illuminated giving the keys the illusion that they are floating on a ""bed of light."" I wish that Razer somehow found a way to also duplicate that bed of light effect on the Huntsman, but I am definitely happy with the extra bright letters. As you can imagine, the lighting on the Huntsman can be customized to pretty much anything you can imagine.

Key Replacement:
I replaced the keycaps on my Huntsman with Doubleshot PBT Keycaps from HyperX, after seeing a popular Youtube personality replace his. (These Keycaps run about $25, and are meant for HyperX's own mechanical keboard.) And while not all the HyperX Keycaps were compatible (the larger keycaps for RETURN, SHIFT, SPACEBAR, etc did not fit the Hunstman's switches), I still managed to replace most of the keyscaps. The over all effect is that the keyboard is now even more illuminated. That's because the bottom of the HyperX Keycaps (which are made of white plastic) react with the lighting to give a more brilliant glow to the entire keyboard. Since replacing the keycaps on the Huntsman seemed to work; I would assume a fair number of other keycaps types would probably work for the Huntsman as well. But of course please do your own research before purchasing.

Software:
The Huntsman uses two USB connectors. Once connected, you must download the latest version of Razer Synapse. This is Razer's all-in-one software for all their PC keyboards, mice, etc. I actually own several Razer products, and after using Synapse for over a year, I've gotten used to using it. It's not hard to use, but it could definitely use some interface improvement. Still, most users can easily get to the most important things such as lighting customization, re-assigning keys, and making macros. Razer does require a login with your information for the software to work. The reasoning I suppose is that you can use the same settings if you use the same Razer products on several PCs. I would assume that most people don't use this feature - but I actually do. I use Razer products at my home and at my work - so this actually works well for me. Settings that I make at home can easily be assigned at my work and vice-versa.

Conclusion:
The Huntsman is a pretty pricey keyboard with exceptional build quality. The body is metal, and the keys are stabilized so that there is minimum ""wobble."" Add to this the ""fast"" actuation feel, and you have an excellent high-end keyboard. Gaming, and typing feel really great. If you can forgive the ""loud"" keys, this is an excellent option if you're looking for a high-end keyboard for gaming and work.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$89.99 ,,,Andrew,Feels Great and Responds Great.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2018","OK... first off what I wasn't really happy about. I just got my shipment yesterday the package came opened the seal tape the keeps the box closed was already cut. That was a little upsetting but I'll get over it. Another bad thing.. the media keys that are on my keyboard are not working. I'm sure its not the keyboard itself because when I first plugged it in they were working fine so it must be a program on my computer that is overlapping spotify and youtube... I just havent figured it out yet, and no its not google music on chrome browser. Lastly the app that comes with the Razer keyboard.. super laggy at first... but after I restarted my computer worked just fine... and was able to customize the colors to my liking.

OVERALL... the last keyboard I replaced the Huntsman with was the Razer Chroma Black Widow I had it for around 5 years .. and I have to say it is nothing like it!!.. The Huntsman blows that keyboard out of the water. This keyboard feels great sounds great and I am in LOVE with it. It is super smooth to type on and game on. I read one of the negative reviews for the keyboard after I purchased it saying ""my fat fingers press down on the keyboard to hard and the stands collapse.!"" haven't had that issue. Also the wrist cushion stays in place and is super comfy.

IF you are up in the air right now and can't decided wither or not to get the k95 or razer huntsman? Get the Huntsman you won't be disappointed",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$46.92 ,104,104,,Entertaining keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020","
   This is an entertaining keyboard.  I thought that I'd  just keep it as my backup , but while I was testing it, I've become rather fond of it.  The feeling of typing on it is fairly normal.  Because they're mechanical keys, they sit a little higher than on a normal membrane keyboard.There are 19 different lighting styles included with it.  Some are interactive, as shown in the video.  Others are displays that run independently of any keystrokes.  That's all it can do.  I don't see any way to integrate other RGB lighting systems with it.  It's still nifty.If you don't touch type,  you may have problems with this keyboard.  Without the keys illuminate, it's very hard to see the markings.  I currently have it set as shown in the video.  They don't light until after I touch it, and that fades away a few seconds later.  So the keys are unreadable until I type again.My normal requirements for a keyboard are pretty simple.  I want all the standard keys, in the standard locations.  Some manufactures switch around the \| and enter shape and position.  Some move the ins/del cluster.  I need them all in the standard locations.  Being that I do lots of systems and programming work, the \| key is rather important.I also need to have a roller or knob for volume control.  I don't want to mess around with Fn keys to change the volume.  Especially where every manufacturer has their own mappings for the volume.

  I received this product in exchange for my honest review as part of the Amazon Vine Program. Seller Brand: FIODIO lists this as ""FIODIO Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, LED Rainbow Gaming Backlit, 104 Anti-ghosting Keys, Quick-Response Quiet Black Switches, Multimedia Control for PC and Desktop Computer, with Removable Hand Rest"". This keyboard has the best feature I've seen to control the LED lighting effects and brightness. The round lit top right corner button in Picture 2 turns to dial in and depresses to select the brightness, LED color and cycling, and other options - A SUPER FEATURE I loved, so much easier than using weird function key combos another lighted KB I have uses. I also liked the hand rest that is magnetic for attaching to the keyboard instead of having plastic clips - another great design choice in my opinion. Makes it easier for me to remove to clean under it, I can take it off without touching the KB if I want. The non-clicky black mechanical switches are very solid; I like them over the click type but that's a personal choice. I did not like the silver rims on the key faces and found them distracting. This KB was USB Plug and Play, I recommend it for the selectable LED Lighting effects (or none), sturdy construction, gaming programmable keys and hand rest design. Well made with a hefty metal feel, I can pound the keys without it budging! Recommended.

  Got this for general use but also trying to get more into computer gaming.  Got this plugged into a switch that is powered from a Mac and Windows machine.  The keyboard feels good to type on and Easy to control the colors via the wheel and program buttons.  I just leave the spinner on color editing mode instead of volume.  The colors look good and I can quickly adjust it from moving to all on to game keys.  I could easily adjust the ALT/WIN/CTRL to match my Mac via the keyboard controls in Mac Settings and Windows worked fine out of the box.  I got this plugged into a basic hub that powers the mouse and camera too and have no issue.  I will say when plugged into the Mac the color comes on randomly sometimes at night; no issue from my Windows laptop.  But not a big issue and my hub has a kill switch for USB devices so I can easily turn it off from the hub if bothering but FYI in case you have this in same room you sleep in.

It has legs on the front so you can have it at an angle.At first I was upset that it wasn’t linking to my computer. Then I finally realized that the batteries that came with the keyboard were individually wrapped in thin plastic. I hadn’t even noticed and installed them with the darn plastic still on. DUHHHH. Worked perfect once I took the plastic off. *update* the space bar is a tad squeaky and I’ve exchanged it with another. Not as bad, but still squeaking. I like it otherwise so I’m keeping it.

  It is cute. The small 0 on the 10-key takes some getting used to. Need to strike keys rather hard if you are a fast typer. It often misses strokes, but getting into a good rhythm with strong strokes fixes that. It is not a quiet keyboard and the space bar squeaks and has gotten louder the more it is used, but it does its job. The mouse, which I find a bit small, does not have an on/off option, so I expect to use a lot of batteries, but it does seem to have some kind of sleep mode.

",$32.99 ,,,W. Kwok,"Batteries not included, but this is simple and minimalist","Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2019","
  If you are looking for a minimalist keyboard and mouse, this is it. The batteries are not included, so you'll need to have a total of 4 AAA batteries available if you want to use this keyboard and mouse combo. Each device uses 2 AAA batteries. The keyboard does not have raised feet in the back to elevate it at an angle like most keyboards do. Also, the mouse does not have any side buttons for browsing backwards and forwards. However, what this set lacks in extras it makes up for in functionality and ease of use. The keyboard is mostly silent and comes with a rubber protective cover. The mouse clicks are nearly silent and the scroll wheel is responsive and adjustable. The wireless USB connector is hidden in the keyboard's battery compartment. When not in use, you can store the USB connector back in the keyboard. Overall, this set has a simple design that just works without all the extra bells and whistles.

",$32.99 ,,,Simon H.,Great portability at the cost of ergonomics.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2019","1 week report:
I bought the Jellycomb wireless keyboard and mouse as part of my back-to-school office as I am starting grad school. I had done some online research as I knew this what I would be rolling with for the next 5 years and was exhausting my gear budget. I've had this thing for a week now writing essays, browsing the internet, making ppt presentations, watching youtube etc. I am very pleased with it. (Full setup: LG gram 17, Philips 27"" monitor, Jellycomb wireless keyboard+mouse, Anker Soundcore2 BT speakers, Saiji folding laptop stand.)

1. Both the keyboard and the mouse are very thin and low profile which is great for portability. If you have larger hands like me the mouse will be uncomfortable at first but I'm getting used to it. The keyboard does not have the height adjustment legs that most keyboards have so you are stuck with the thinness unless you want to stick a book or something beneath it.
2. The wireless connection has never broke even when in another room. We use our monitor to watch Youtube or Netflix from our sofa while eating and the multimedia keys on the keyboard are very useful to change the volume etc at a distance.
3. The mouse buttons are near silent and have good responsive tactical feel. The keyboard buttons aren't loud like a mechanical keyboard but there are close to an average laptop keyboard in both sound and keystroke depth. The plastic cover is a bit sticky, fits very well and does deafen the sound a little bit.
4. The minimalistic design is great. I don't mind the Jellycomb logo as much as I thought I might. Everything else is stellar with no abnormal key positions what so ever.

Overall very satisfied with the product especially at this price point. The trade off of ergonomics for portability is one that can be both a pro or a con so I'll leave it at that.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  Loving this keyboard and mouse set from Jelly Comb. From the clean and sturdy packaging I already knew this was a quality product, and the unboxing did not disappoint. The keyboard is exceptionally slim with rounded corners that give it a friendly yet functional look and performance. The mouse is medium-sized, easy to transport. One thing I love is the on and off switches for the devices are easy to find, flip and easy to determine whether they are on or off--none of these things are true of my more expensive Apple mouse and keyboard. Tracking on the mouse is solid; it doesn't get hung up. The keyboard is relatively quiet but still has a little but of a satisfying click that I prefer when typing. I dig Jelly Comb's products and this set is no exception!

  One drawback to this keyboard, if you use the row of function keys frequently in your work (F1, F2, etc.) you'll find you have to hit a function key at the bottom of the keyboard before using a function - which can be an inconvenience if you use them frequently, which I do. Other than this minor gripe, this is an excellent keyboard with great feel and responsiveness. Mouse goes to sleep, meaning you have to left click after a while before it will respond, which I'm not a fan of. If none of this bothers you then you should love it.

",$32.99 ,,,L. Lawrence Jr.,meets my expectations,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2019","
  My early review based on a few hours usage is that the keyboard and mouse work quite well. I'm chiefly interested in using both for occasional presentations where the presenter is several yards from a laptop wired to a monitor. All the keys and the mouse worked quite well in my testing which was conducted only a few feet from the laptop. The NUM LOCK, CAPS LOCK, and POWER LED indicators are quite welcome. They remain lit during active typing, but go off before the keyboard goes asleep in order to preserve battery life. Keyboard and mouse awaken reliably about 3 seconds after depressing a key or mouse button. The mouse awakens faster than the keyboard. I would have liked a means to raise the top end of the keyboard to make typing more comfortable. Otherwise I have no complaints about the feel of the keyboard. I rather like the chiclet style keys. I find chiclet keyboards easier to keep clean than keyboards that have full travel keys. I also like the plastic membrane that's included. It adhered to the keyboard very well in my short test. It probably would not fare as well for portable keyboard usage. I can't comment on long term battery life or how it works at a distance.

Logitech MK470 Slim Wireless Combo - Off White






",$49.99 ,Logitech,,Kason,Video comparison: MK470 vs. MK235 - Quietest keyboard and mouse combo?,"Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2020"," My previous keyboard was the Logitech K520 + M310 mouse which always performed well for me. The keyboard and mouse have standard key and mouse click sounds...nothing out of the norm.

With having more conf/video calls the K520 keyboard caused noise issues while taking notes on calls. While I can mute myself, it's not optimal if you're one of the primary participants that trying to take notes and be fluid.

After searching on ""quiet or silent keyboards"" I ordered the MK470 and MK235 keyboard mouse combo sets. While not technically ""silent"" the MK470 is the quieter keyboard between the two and much quieter than the original keyboard + mouse combo. in the attached video I tried to be as consistent and realistic when illustrating the sounds of the keys and mouse clicks. All of this is objective and i'm simply trying to give a helpful review for others who may have the same needs.

In an additional effort to reduce keystroke noise I also purchased an inexpensive wireless headset to move the mic further away from the keyboard vs. being located on my earbud cord. Switching to the headset itself could possibly reduce the keyboard noise heard on a call, but that said, I have co-workers who use the K520 during meetings with their webcam + mics that are mounted on the top of their monitor and the keystroke noise is quite intense. Again, many factors to consider in mic quality, etc.

Overall i like the MK470. It is a condensed full keyboard that types like a laptop keyboard. The keys are quieter than most and I've confirmed the ability to type during meetings w/out being disruptive. The only short-term challenge for me is getting used to the location of the forward delete button which is differnt than a full-sized extended keyboard layout. I will be recommending this keyboard to my co-workers who also need to type during calls. Good luck to you in our new norm and I hope this was helpful.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I was looking for a bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo since I do a lot of typing and work from home. I borrowed a mechanical keyboard from my nephew and boy did I make the wrong decision! So loud! I had a smaller bluetooth keyboard, the Logitech K380, but I missed not having a 10-key. Did some research on keyboards that wouldn't break the bank and found this. I didn't need a mouse, but for the combination, why not? It's great, so nice and quiet and feels super comfy, I would recommend a wrist rest because it lays pretty flat. I wish the keyboard had an on/off switch but it doesn't bother me too much since half the time I forget to turn it off anyways. I highly recommend.

",$49.99 ,Logitech,,Julia M.,"Slim, Quiet, FLAWED","Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2020","Update: Had to come down to 1 star from 5 star for one reason - this is NOT a Logitech unifying device. If you lose the tiny USB connector, you are SOL and must replace the whole thing rather than be able to connect to the unifying USB receiver. The main reason I bought this laptop was to travel, but I don't use the mouse it comes with, so there is no off/off switch on the keyboard and nowhere to nest/store the USB receiver during transit. It's really easy to lose as a result. Can't recommend because of the hassle I'm facing now.

This is just the keyboard I was looking for to enhance working from home! I will even use it when I'm traveling. I previously got a laptop stand that is great for ergonomic posture, but was awkward to type on.

Pros:
+ Setup is instant. I have to admit I was worried that it would be tricky to set up the Bluetooth but all you do is plug in the small USB receiver and you're all set :)
+ Stylish and super slim, great for people of any height as you won't have to bend your wrist to access the keys on a tabletop or desk.
+ Works perfectly with the Kensington slim wrist rest!! Seriously like made for each other. I am used to a plastic wrist rest and hate the thick bubble gel ones. This one is flat, smooth (leatherette feel), and firm.

Cons:
The mouse they include... I guess it's nice that both the mouse and keyboard use the same USB receiver, but it's not a good mouse. I LOVE my Logitech M330 wireless mouse and wish they included one like that in the package. Super minor con for me since I already have a wireless mouse that I love.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

I own a wacom cintiq (Im a 3D asset developer) I often need to use keyboard shortcuts with working... and my cintiq (which I also use a lot) sits on a desk extension to my right, which has its own keyboard drawer (but its much smaller... a standard keyboard doesnt fit) It was really awkward to use my normal keyboard, coz its way over to the left... so I had to lean way over or try to fit it on the smaller keyboard drawer. It was quite annoying for some tasks.

I decided to buy this and have both keyboards on my machine... but this one is for just working on the cintiq, and using keyboard shortcuts when I need to. Between the cintiq and the second keyboard, its like having a second computer - I can now do all kinds of things on it, utilizing it as a second monitor, as well as a drawing tablet. It has really increased my workflow speed with lots of different tasks. And its great coz its wireless... so you can really move it about, and still get a strong signal.

The keyboard itself is lovely... space saving, quiet typing (much like a laptop's keys feel) and its heavy for a little keyboard. Its quite sturdy and seems very well built. As for the mouse, I'm not using that atm... so Ive stored it away in case I need a spare.

  I have wanted to replace my wired full-size keyboard/mouse for a long time but haven't pulled the trigger until now. I'm sorry I waited so long! This keyboard/mouse combo is EXACTLY what I wanted without having to spend a ton of money. The keys feel nice and clicky without being too loud and the mouse is dead silent when clicking the buttons. The rounded squarish buttons on the keyboard also give it a little bit more style than your standard compact set of keys. The keyboard has a nice weight to it and appears to be made of metal on the base side and plastic on the keys side. The mouse fits my hand well (medium-sized man hands) and feels good when moving it around or scrolling with the large scroll ball in the middle. This combo was super easy to get set up too! I popped in the required batteries (two AAAs for the keyboard & one AA for the mouse), plugged in the USB receiver and it started working immediately! (Don't forget to turn the keyboard on with the switch in the back!) I was also pleasantly surprised that all of the function keys worked flawlessly with my Win10 PC!

Logitech K380 Multi-Device Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard - Off White






",$39.99 ,Logitech,,Matthew,Perfect size and function make it a great choice for Android devices,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2015","
  To start with I would like to mention that this is the first review I have written and I felt compelled to do so after seeing that there weren't many reviews yet, one of which was overwhelmingly negative.Pairing:I bought the keyboard to use with my Nexus 9 (android) tablet.  Out of the box pairing was a breeze and following the instructions on the slip sheet it took <1min to pair with my tablet.  While writing this review I also paired it with my phone (Nexus 5) with equal ease.  As advertised it was easy to switch between the two without re-pairing by selecting the proper ""device button"" at the top of the keyboard.Functionality:One of the reasons I selected this keyboard over others was because it is adaptive to different OS's and would allow for full use of the different function keys with my device. So far I have found all of the special keys to function properly with my Nexus 9, these include the ""home"" button, the button that allows you to toggle through different windows, the ""back"" button and the audio short cut butttons.  So far I have found the use of these convenient while browsing.  Additionally, traditional short cuts like ""F5"" to referesh and ""ctrl+C"" & ""ctrl+V"" to copy and paste also work.  To me this is a definite plus as sometimes the copy and paste operations can be tricky with a touch screen and no keyboard.Typing Experience:I am a fairly proficient typist who can type by touch without looking at the keys and I find that I can type at my normal rate with this keyboard without having to slow down due to its size.  I find the size to be big enough to allow you to type comfortably while also being compact enough that it could easily be put in a bag and taken with you if you are on the go.  When typing the keys are fairly quiet and have a nice feel to the key press.  One of my main trepidations with this product was the round keys, but I haven't found them to have any impact on the typing experience.  In fact the keys are nice and concave making it easy for your fingers to rest on them as opposed to the flat style keys that some products use.Overall Impressions:I find the keyboard to be solid and good quality and would highly recommend it.  I mainly use it with my tablet while sitting on the couch and have found it to be comfortable to use while setting on my lap.  The size makes it comfortable to use on a regular basis while still being easily portable and the compatibility of the different function keys makes it easy and convenient to use with Android devices.

Logitech K380 Multi-Device Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard - Off White






",$39.99 ,Logitech,,Curtis Rueden,"Versatile keyboard, but bad for intense use","Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019","People use computers in a lot of different ways. There is no one-size-fits-everyone keyboard. This keyboard already has many reviews, and while I did not read all of them, I did not see any existing reviews focusing on the specific problems I have with this keyboard. I am adding my experience here for the folks who have similar needs to mine.

TL;DR: Lots of good qualities, but bad for intense keyboarding sessions.
- Pros: 1) $30; 2) quick-switch over 3 devices; 3) sturdy and portable; 4) same form factor as an Apple keyboard; 5) feels good to type on.
- Cons: 1) It drops key presses when typing quickly; 2) Software support is bad; 3) Fn key behavior is hardcoded and cannot be overridden.

BACKGROUND
I purchased the Logitech K380 to use as a full-time keyboard at a desk with my MacBook Pro (MBP) 2018 laptop, which unfortunately has a keyboard infamous for malfunctioning. I recently had my laptop's keyboard replaced due to worsening issues, and decided to start using an external keyboard to minimize wear and tear on the new one.

This review focuses on what I personally need in a keyboard as a software engineer who types rapidly (~130 WPM) with a keyboard-shortcut-intensive usage style. People who use a keyboard in a more casual way, and who do not care about customizing the keyboard's behavior, will probably not encounter the issues I discuss here.

My requirements for an external keyboard are:

- As accurate as possible when typing at 130+ WPM.
- Exact same form factor as MBP keyboard, to unify muscle memory across the built-in and external keyboards.
- Real function keys which can be set to act as F keys by default.

I basically wanted my laptop's built-in keyboard, but as an external keyboard. Hey, Apple makes one of those! It's called the Apple Magic Keyboard (Wireless, Rechargable). So why didn't I just buy that? Two reasons. First, the price: $99+ is expensive. Second, I had bad experiences with Apple wireless keyboards from a few years ago: several keyboards which refused to pair, or would spontaneously unpair after a while.

I have been a Logitech fan for many years, having enjoyed using many of their keyboards and mice on desktop PCs. When I saw that the Logitech K380 had a nearly identical form factor to the Magic keyboard including fn key, had strong reviews, was only $30 on Amazon, and supported quick-switching across devices, I decided to give it a try.

PROS - This keyboard has a lot going for it:

1) Affordable. This keyboard is a great value for the price.

2) Quick-switch over multiple devices. Having tried several different means of tackling the ""one keyboard, multiple machines"" problem, I can say that quick bluetooth pairing has big advantages. Each switch only takes about 1 second, and it ""just works,"" unlike Synergy, which requires networking your machines together and running special server software, or a USB KVM switch, which requires several cables and adapters.

3) Sturdy and portable. Some other reviews complained about these aspects. But I think it is exactly the right weight (1.17 lbs): it stays put while you type. And it's a small form factor keyboard which fits easily into a backpack or larger purse. If it were any more portable (e.g. foldable), it would suffer in durability or typing performance.

4) Same form factor as an Apple keyboard. I use macOS, and care about consistency across my keyboards. This keyboard is close enough to the Apple form factor that it feels pretty seamless switching between keyboards. It has all four modifier keys on the bottom left (fn, ctrl, start/alt/opt, alt/cmd ⌘), which is a big plus for me. Although beware that fn and control are reversed from Apple keyboards—more on that in ""CONS"" below.

5) Feels good to type on. This is highly subjective. But personally, I really like the feel of typing on this keyboard. The keys have a nice amount of travel: more than a MBP 2018, less than a classic 101-key keyboard e.g. from a Dell PC. The rounded keys are slightly strange at first but quickly become unnoticeable. Relatedly: another Amazon review mentions key presses happening repeatedly and sporadically, making correct typing nigh-impossible. This sounds like a defective keyboard to me—I have had zero problems with mine in that vein.

CONS - Despite all of the above, using this keyboard intensely day after day is frustrating:

1) It drops key presses when typing quickly. In particular, certain combinations of keys, when pressed together, prevent additional key presses from registering. This is best illustrated with an example. Try typing the word ""furious"" as fast as you can. When I type this word on the Logitech K380, it nearly always comes out ""furiou"", with the S missing.

Why? Each key typed has two parts: the press and the release. When typing quickly, you often press the next key (sometimes the next 3-4 keys) before releasing a previous key. Good keyboards will allow this. But on my K380, if I press O, then press U, then press S, without releasing any of them, the S does not register. It's not that the keyboard cannot handle three keys at once: the word ""out"" for example comes out just fine. But the word ""plastic"" eats the S. It's not just the S key though, because the words ""nose"" and ""poster"" work even with all keys held at once. But ""please"" eats the S, and ""purse"" eats the E. I am not sure, but it feels like a hardware just has a weird limitation here. It destroys my confidence in this keyboard.

2) The software support is terrible. For macOS, Logitech provides a configuration tool called ""Logi Options"" for configuring the keyboard. It has nearly no features. One option it does have is ""Use all F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys"" which sounds great in theory. As a software developer who needs to press combinations like cmd+shift+F11 on a regular basis, I strongly prefer this option to be enabled, so I don't have to press fn+cmd+shift+F11 instead (ugh). For the special functions (pause/unpause, next track, volume up, volume down, etc.), although I use them all the time, I never need to press them in combination with the other modifier keys like shift or ctrl, so holding fn for them is OK. I also use fn+arrow keys all the time for pg up, pg down, home and end, because there are no such dedicated keys on these small form factor keyboards.

Unfortunately, this feature does not work reliably. When switching devices, the keyboard ""forgets"" that this option was enabled, and F keys go back to being not-F-keys again, and the next time you press F3 to dig into some code or switch terminal tabs or whatever, boom, your keyboard is unpaired again. And opening Logi Options and toggling the option back and forth does not fix it! It seems like after some unspecified amount of time, the keyboard just silently ""flips"" back to F-keys being F-keys again. But the inconsistency there makes it impossible to retain trustworthy muscle memory on the keyboard. And the weirdness does not stop there. Even when F-keys are not being F-keys (either because the keyboard was recently repaired, or because the box in Logi Options is unchecked and taken effect), the behavior of e.g. fn+up/down seems inconsistent: sometimes it's brightness up/down, and other times it's the equivalent of left alt+up/down (as reported by Karabiner Event Viewer). There are times when it becomes impossible to type pg up, pg down, home and/or end, due to the keyboard's inconsistency in behavior. And not being able to type those four keys puts a big damper on fast text editing.

These segues into the final nail in this keyboard's coffin:

3) Fn key behavior is hardcoded and cannot be overridden.

There is a great macOS tool called Karabiner Elements which lets you completely remap all your keys to behave however you want. So my plan for dealing with the weirdness of Logi Options was: I'll just use the Karabiner Event Viewer to figure out what keyboard events this keyboard is sending out, and remap everything to behave as closely as possible to an Apple keyboard. Problem solved! But you can't: pressing fn sends no key event. The keyboard only sends a keyboard event to your computer in response to keys pressed while fn is held. So e.g. pressing fn+up (sometimes! see above) sends the same thing as left alt+up. Thus, there is no way in software to detect the difference between fn+up and left alt+up, and therefore no way to program them to do different things. (For the GitHub-inclined, there is an issue in the Karabiner Elements issue tracker about it: pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements#999.)

This problem also means that you cannot switch the location of the ctrl and fn keys, which are reversed from their layout on Apple keyboards. Bummer—I bought this keyboard with the hope of being able to do that.

I tried with Logi Options installed and Karabiner Elements uninstalled. I tried vice versa. I tried both installed. I tried neither installed. Rebooting in between configuration changes. But nothing worked. I could not find any way to capture an fn key press alone, nor to switch the locations of the ctrl and fn keys to match an Apple keyboard. (When Karabiner Elements is installed, the Keyboard Modifier Keys dialog in System Preferences gains a ""Function (fn) key"" for the K380, but sadly it does not work. And you still cannot map any other modifier key to fn either.)

In conclusion, I heartily recommend this keyboard for casual use of slow-to-moderate speed typists. And vehemently recommend against it for intense typists and power users who want control over their keyboard's behavior.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

It's a solid buy, comes with nice gateron switches (mine had blues). There are cons although they are relatively small ones.

Another thing I'd like to address is the microphone on the pcb. It is a cool feature to have a rgb mode synced with the sound around you, I found it kind of strange.

After a few days — and after trying it out myself (I review Apple products and accessories for a living), we sent the Apple Smart Keyboard back to Apple for a refund and bought the Slim Folio the 7th Gen iPad. It’s flawless, although a little on the thick side.

  This is my second Slim Folio Keyboard Case for iPad; I just bought a new iPad, and of course, the size of that device has changed ever so slightly, so I had to get a new case.  I LOVED my first Slim Folio, a solid 5 stars.  Keyboard worked well, responsive, just enough depth to let me know I pushed down on a key, and the keys are separate enough to accommodate bigger hands.  The new Slim Folio keyboard is the same, and that’s the most important thing.  However, the protection around the iPad has been hardened and increased, and while that seems like a good idea on its face, the old, lighter weight design did a great job protecting my old iPad.  I’m klutzy; I dropped the whole thing a number of times, and the softer keyboard corners did a great job protecting the iPad, even if the Slim Folio corners looked a bit beat up over the years.  The other change with this new case is the angle at which the new iPad sits up for use — now the iPad sets up slightly more vertical to the keyboard.  It’s not a deal killer, but I liked the old angle (there’s only one angle with the Slim Folio), b/c it worked better when I use it in my lap (b/c I’m looking down at the screen from a greater height).  I still like this newer keyboard enough to buy it and keep it, but I am sad to lose the lighter weight, earlier version that worked just fine.

I bought a cheap Finite brand case first. This one seemed great. It folded nicely, the keyboard was removable and the material was acceptable. Great viewing angles and able to move the magnetic keyboard or detach completely. The keyboard however, was horrible. Super loud and felt like it was from a $.25 gum ball machine.

I decided to bite the bullet and buy this one. At first it seemed great. The keyboard is amazing, sturdy and quiet (which is one of the most important features I was looking for. There is only one viewing angle which is not ideal for plane rides or typing while it's on your lap on the couch in or bed. The biggest gripe I have with this is the tablet mode. When holding it in this mode, the iPad part slips below the back part with the keyboard. If you pick it up loosely with one hand it will slip. If you use it on the couch or in bed and you adjust yourself, it will slip. The only way to prevent this is to ALWAYS grip it firmly with one hand or use two hands (Which doesn't work if you're playing games or swiping with one hand). Also, when folded the keyboard is on the outside and can get scratched or dirty. If you fold it inside, the case doesn't line up properly and still has the slip issue.

Unfortunately, I will be returning this and continuing the search for the ""Perfect"" case, which I highly doubt exists. Just ordered the Logitech combo keyboard/trackpad and the Rugged Folio. I will see if these are any better, but I highly doubt it.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

This keyboard has many great little features, like volume control buttons for those of us who have a monitor with built in speakers, and in particular those of us whose monitor speaker volume button broke, and can only control the volume via the windows icon or the keyboard *ahem*. It also has a little calculator button in the corner. As someone who is studying for his engineering degree, this little button is already coming in handy!

The keyboard itself is quite ergonomic, with the keys gently curving to enable faster typing. It's taking a little adjusting for me, as I'm used to the old fashioned keyboards that are flat, but I'm already noting a faster typing speed than before. The other nice feature, which I mentioned in the title, is that the keyboard is so quiet!

This is what ninjas use when they have to Google their targets. Nice and stealthy.

I've been using it for a few months now, and work from home so I'm typing away on it daily. My previous keyboards were insanely loud, and honestly hurt to use after a while. This is definitely a different case: it's quiet enough that I can use it late at night without being a nuisance, and typing is honestly comfortable. There's a very slight vertical curve for the key placement, and it absolutely helps with how typing on it feels.

The build quality is also far better than you'd expect for the price - I've picked up very crappy keyboards with very low build quality for $15, and went into this expecting to potentially replace it after a while. Thankfully, that wasn't the case.

That's most of the positives, but now on to my (pretty minor) gripes:

While the media keys are mostly fine, I feel like they both could and should be placed farther from the function keys. I end up lowering my volume just about every single time I go to push F6, which is sadly often. The function keys also feel a tad small for my preference, but that's not a gigantic issue.

After the third one I decided to just buy one for myself (already had bought myself a wireless mouse).Since this was an out of pocket work expense I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money but I wanted something that would be reliable and hold up to moderate to heavy use for at least a few years, be fairly quiet (I work in a cubicle) and have a fairly low resistance key stroke.  I came very close to getting the logitech solar powered wireless keyboard, but it was a bit more than I wanted to spend (~$40) and there were enough reviews complaining about the battery crapping out after a year or two that I decided to go for a dirt cheap wired keyboard.I can't yet speak to the durability (it arrived yesterday evening), but I'm happy enough with the performance on the other criteria, particularly considering the low price.  Could it be quieter? for sure!  Could the keys have a bit less resistance? I suppose... but, hey, it's a vast improvement over the last POS keyboard I was given (which was the cleanest and most functional one yet!) and what are you expecting from a $14 keyboard?!?!

Logitech Keyboard Folio for iPad 2G/3G/4G - Carbon Black (Renewed)






",$18.42 ,,,Jacob,"The tactile fabric on the case feels good, though it has a small tendency to hold ...","Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2015","
  I am afraid I must give this folio a  single star not for the quality of its function, but because it stopped functioning less than a month after I received it. When I tried to contact the seller about the 90 day warranty I was given Logitech's number for technical support. The support person confirmed that the keyboard is dead and needs replacing, but since the keyboard was not purchased directly from Logitech they are not the ones to replace it. There was some initial difficulty on the phone because one of the identifying stickers giving the model number seems to be missing.I will change my rating at such point as I get satisfaction from the seller. The folio itself is solid protection for my iPad. The tactile fabric on the case feels good, though it has a small tendency to hold stains--easily wipeable though.My previous iPad case from Logitech was good but was not a folio, which was what I would have preferred in the first place. Some people might find it a little bulky or heavy, but since I used to lug around a 15"" MacBook it's still fine for me. I can accept that some keyboards will be defective, but when that happens I do not appreciate a runaround.

  Fantastic product, keys felt nice to type on. Case was a nice sleek design that fit with by business profile. Never had any issues with it. It also withheld a good bit of running in the rain as well and still functioned perfectly! Camera hole wasn't obstructive like most cases are. Black finish hid any scratches or marks on the case which made it look like it was in perfect condition all the time.

  This does not fit my iPad. The width is good but height is too much; the iPad does not securely fit and falls out too easily. Overall, it is very heavy, thick and bulky feeling such that I would not like to carry the iPad around. The keyboard layout is a little odd with the caps lock key combined with the A key, making it larger and throws off finger placement for touch typing. You have to use function+caps lock/A to turn on/off caps lock. Don’t like it. Some people may like the tactile feel springiness of the keys when typing, but that is a small plus to the big negatives of bulkiness, heaviness and lack of fit

  This keyboard is perfect for everyday typing. I got this so that I could put my laptop on a monitor stand and use a wireless keyboard. The keys are easy to strike and I really enjoy that part of it. There are two things I’m not a fan of. First and most inconvenient, if you’re using the number pad side of the keyboard, PAY ATTENTION TO THE KEY PLACEMENT. This keyboard is not set up like your standard keyboard. As someone who types dates all day and uses the enter button from the number pad after typing numbers, having the /, Enter, and 0 button in a different place consistently messes me up. It’s so hard to hit that small / button accurately while maintaining a good typing speed. Second, typing on this keyboard is pretty loud. I’m used to quiet keys on my laptop and work computer but this one is very loud. Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.

The numeric keyboard addition is well worth the $10 additional as not only do we get the keypad, this keyboard is quieter than the smaller version. You do still hear the clicks of the keys, but it isn't bothersome to me. The aluminum finish looks sleek and matches my aluminum laptop.

",$23.99 ,,,Bijan Karshenas,Extremely practical as well as comfortable,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2020","Since I tend to shy away from mechanical keyboards thanks to their significant thickness and the wrist pain that causes me, I've spent the last couple weeks researching slim, small form-factor keyboards, and I only came upon this one after trying out Arteck's 2.4 Ghz wireless keyboard (Model #: HW193) and returning it because of hardware issues I was having.

Thankfully, this keyboard hasn't sprung any surprises yet, and has been everything I'd hoped for in a wireless, slim keyboard for my desktop. The keys are full-sized, so someone like me, who has relatively large hands, is able to use it without much wrist or finger fatigue, and, while some people may prefer some height adjustment for their keyboard, I'm liking the flat style for ergonomics and easy of typing.

For some, having the top row of buttons utilize functions like volume adjustment and media controls by default will mess with your workflow, but I wouldn't have it any other way, as I don't use the regular keyboard function keys more often than the play/pause or volume adjustments. The number pad is just as responsive as the rest of the keyboard, and I don't miss any of the buttons they've removed to keep things compact (like the Home or Insert keys).

All in all, I'd highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who's preferences lean toward slim, responsive keyboards, that include a number pad, with multimedia function keys front and center.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I got this keyboard after many others. I recently had to start working on a PC after decades of being a Mac user. I'm a fairly fast and accurate typist and was struggling with the large Dell keyboard everyone has used before. I tried 4 more lower profile keyboards and saw a slight improvement. Then I found this OMotion keyboard!!! The price was fantastic and I was super excited to try it when it arrived. The spacing is IDENTICAL to my Magic keyboard!! I can type again and am so happy!!! The key press is just a touch higher and harder, but not nearly enough to complain. The plastic of the keys does have a slight traction and a perfectly flat top as oppose to the matte finish and faint indent feel of the Apple. It isn't a dupe per say, but very comparable.

  Have Keyboard, Will Type is very entertaining to read. Mr. Webb’s humor makes parts of the book rather funny.

The book was so engaging I did not want to put it down.  My biggest take away from the book in this regard I already do.  I write the review and then edit the results after the review has been written.  Unlike Mr. Webb, I was taught to do this in college.  When I first starting writing reviews, my first was in 2015.  I would think, what do I say about the book.  My early reviews were short.  Over time they became longer and I note ideas that pop into my head as I am reading the book.

  Part memoir and part how-to, this book offers exhortations, admonitions, and affirmations in good measure to writers regardless of their station. On offer from author Webb is a comprehensive overview of contemporary publishing markets, presented in an entertaining, unabashed, and oftentimes audacious manner. Market characteristics are sure to change, not unlike those Webb points out over the course of his life and, more recently, his career as a published author. This book provides a helpful snapshot regardless, offering actionable items for today’s writer and context for writers reading in the future. And many insights Webb offers—several repeated throughout—are timeless indeed. His useful primer on dealing with naysayers, for example, examining not just what “they” say but also why they might say such things. Another: how to discern whether what’s worked for them/there/then may or may not work for you/here/now.

Knowing the ins and outs of an industry and how to make that work for you.  The importance of having a skin like an alligator and how to turn a negative review into a positive.

But to be more specific anyone who is writing or trying to sell their book to agents and/or publishers or is thinking about self-publishing. Not a writer? This book still offers great advice on getting your business or product noticed.

William Alan Webb uses humor and straightforward advice to share his success in achieving best seller status in his writing career. He offers a glimpse into the world of indie publishing with wisdom and wit while advising would-be authors what they should and should not do in their pursuit of publication.

Using the model of Stephen King’s book, On Writing, he starts with some background about his life before he became a successful writer and continues the story to where he is today—a successful novelist.

In a no-holds-barred approach, Webb tells you like it is AND in a very entertaining way. You may or may not agree with everything he says—he tells you no problem—but his approach put him on the best seller lists on Amazon. Take what you want from it, skip what you don’t like, and see if it helps you achieve the amazing success Webb enjoys. BUT, if you skip something, and it doesn't work, you might want to reconsider his approach.

In a world where anyone can publish if they want to, this is a must-read. If nothing else, read it to enjoy Webb's wonderful story-telling voice.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

First the likes: The mouse and keyboard are EXTREMELY quiet. The keyboard cover was nice and fit perfectly (I think it would’ve been hard to type without it). Unique look. Easy to set up.

Negatives: mouse pointer would randomly become jumpy on the screen for a few seconds. My typing accuracy and speed definitely declined while using this (got worse when I took the cover off). No legs under the keyboard to make it tilt up. I ended up putting my wireless charger under the front to help. Lastly, the keyboard would randomly go to “sleep” when I typing. That was very frustrating, especially when typing passwords.

Unfortunately, I have requested a return. I really liked this keyboard and wanted it to work. I spent an hour on Amazon to find the right one that wasn’t too expensive.

Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo, Jelly Comb 2.4G Slim Ergonomic Quiet Keyboard and Mouse with Round Keys for Windows, Laptop, PC, Notebook-Black and Gray






",$29.99 ,,,Linda ,I bought a second one for home.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2020","
  I work in a quiet room and my million times an hour mouse clicks were driving me crazy. Plus, my keyboard clicks were annoying too. After reading the reviews from so many happy customers I decided to give this a try despite my husbands remarks of not buying from the main brands on the market. Well this thing is a dream. It is quiet, the keyboard is comfortable and I bought the pink to be wild (which I have gotten compliments on). My hands are less stressed with the design. You feel a click using the mouse but do not hear anything. I sort of had to retrain myself that I had used the function by not hearing it but feeling it. Ya know sometimes when the internet is slow you hear the click and know the command was given. Anyways, the mouse is very smooth and everything was a plug in and go. The circle shaped keys were surprisingly no problem to adapt to. You would think so but there was no negative transition. The silicone cover for the keys is great. My fingers do not slip and I think I type better with it. The white color I wasn't too sure about. For me white is a dirt collector, but this protects your keys from dirt and also any crumbs or lint getting in the groves and is much easier to clean. Try this out, really, if you are undecided. Very well worth a try for the price.  Very happy. I'm going to order another. UPDATE The first one I bought was for my work, I have ordered a second one for home. Am very pleased with these. the second is just as the first and it's pink he he. A really good product. My husband was even impressed with the silent keyboard. And being a major name brand man, that was quite a compliment.

But first, why a wired keyboard? I bought it because I don't like to waste battery power by leaving on wireless keyboards all day, but I also don't like the incessant off and on as the day progresses.

As I have already stated, it has one little problem - at least for me. It might not be a problem for you. The keys stick, especially the space bar. If I am extra careful, there is not as much of a problem.
However, if I want to type quickly and accurately, which is most of the time, it is a small problem. Other than that, it works well and does exactly as I ask. And perhaps other typists might hit the keyboard more forcefully and not have my problem. Or, perhaps some people hunt-and-peck instead of touch-typing, which might work fine.

You should also note that this SR keyboard is identical to another brand, the Cnacnoo, also sold on Amazon. Evidently, the manufacturer places different names so that different vendors can sell seemingly different model.

Alternate recommendation: A better choice is a keyboard brand I've used more, and perhaps it spoiled me.

  As a teacher I have been working from home lately. After sanitizing my laptop with a lysol wipe I think of some of the liquid dripped down inside because some of the keys stopped working.  This left me unable to log in or use the device. So I ordered this keyboard to plug into my laptop so I could continue to use the device.The keyboard is small and very light. It took me a while to get used to the smaller ergonomics of the keyboard, but now I am comfortable with it. My only complaint is some of the keys are not very responsive, one of which being the space bar. So I constantly have to stop in mid sentence and go back and put spaces between words. Needing to use this keyboard as a full time keyboard would not be pleasant or efficient but as a temporary keyboard it isnt bad. Considering the price it is a budget keyboard so one really shouldnt expect super performance at this price point.If I had it to do all over again, considering how much I have to use the keyboard, I would pay more for a better quality one at a higher price point.

  This is a perfect solution for me, in my home office PC.  The only reason I didn't give 5 out of 5 stars, was because my old keyboard had an individual key for the calculator, this keyboard you have to press the Function key then F8 to get to the calculator.  Besides that, this is an excellent replacement for my 6 year old Microsoft keyboard that died on me.  All keys are working flawlessly!  I love the RGB colors and other colors for both the keyboard and mouse.  If I was an avid gamer, I would consider this combo as well.  Some may disagree with me on that statement, but I don't play many games myself.  I just wanted a replacement keyboard and mouse which is wired, and this does the trick, and at a cheaper price than combos that aren't RGB.Also if you're worried about the brightness of the RGB being emitted, no worries there!  I turned off my lights and tried to see if those lights would bother me in another room, and they're not bright enough to bother you for sleeping.  Also you can turn both of the RGB lights off if they're bothersome for you.  The keys have a great feel for typing and the keyboard has to tabs on the bottom to elevate it if you were curious. If this is something for home office or gaming that you need, then get it, you won't go wrong here!

  This is my second purchase of a Havit mechanical KB and mouse combo.  The first one was with a palm rest, it was a PC setup for a family, and it was excellent, they loved it.  I have another build and my nephew doesn’t like using a palm rest, so I decided to get him this combo instead.  It is a good discount without the palm rest.I wish the packaging opens from the top and not from the sides.  Keyboards + mouse are easier to unbox that way.  But other than that, this combo is excellent.  Once you take these out of the box, the first thing you’ll notice is how premium quality this product is.  The aluminum top frame feels very rigid and won’t bend under pressure.  The keycaps are made of plastic with a matte finish.  Comparatively, my primary KB has smooth keycaps and they retain skin oils.  So, this matte finish is easier to maintain and clean.  The blue switches are really clicky, majority of gamers love clicky keys.  But these keys are a little softer to press compared to mainstream mechanical KB blue switches.  But tactile feedback is still excellent.  Testing this KB + mouse combo on some FPS game gave surprising results.  Feedback is good and no key delays or lag.  I’m not a big fan of RGB lights, I just set them to “breathing” mode and forget about it.  This KB+mouse combo has customizable RGB lights.  You can customize them using software, but you can also change them using the FN keys, no need to install additional software.  Same thing with the mouse that has a button to change RGB style.  You can change the DPI settings on the fly on the mouse to 6 different settings, but there is no default for 1200 DPI which most gamers use, the next best thing is 1600 DPI which is only a very small difference in my opinion.  I was able to game with this keyboard for 2 hours straight without any problem.  Performance wise, it only took a few minutes until I got used to the feel of the keyboard and mouse and back to my gaming style.Overall, this combo is an excellent option for budget gaming builds.  They perform on par with those $100+ branded ones.  If you prefer a keyboard with palm rest, then look for their other variant for an additional cost, but if you’re ok without a palm rest, this combo is for you.  Will I buy this again?  Well, this is my second set for another build, so yes.  Highly recommended.

When we calculate, it is better to use these numeric keys to type numbers. Symbols with calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division symbols. These are located in this group of keys. This makes your job much more easier .

Lets begin to talk about the mouse,
the mouse is very comfortable to use .
The mouse's ""skin"" is rubber , It is the outer, hard plastic body that the user guides across a flat surface,
It is important to have a good rubber to make gliding easy .

  I am a first time buyer of PC  products and this keyboard was first to arrive at my door. When I opened the Amazon box I was pleased to find out it was mine and not my brothers package. As I opened I saw a nice black box that I soon figured out was the box cover under that cover was a bright orange box that said ""Hello! Thank you for choosing Havit."" This was a nice introduction to the new keyboard and mouse combo I had ordered. The packaging was great too. This box had latches that held the rest of the cardboard in place until unlatched. I will definitely reuse the box. Upon opening it I saw a mouse with its own nice and tidy plastic compartment and a keyboard wrapped in a nice soft packaging material that covered it almost entirely except from the side that it was pulled out from. I plugged both the keyboard and mouse in and they both worked as advertised. It took a couple seconds to get the lights running but it did in fact work. The lights flooded rainbow color across the board and the mouse started in its red position then started ""breathing"" colors. I did see music changing keys that also excited me.Reading through the manual that was included I figured out a couple new things about the keyboard and mouse. One thing I didn't figure out is how to change your keyboard and/or mouse to a specific color of your choosing. I still don't know if it is possible but If its not I would be fine with it. Although if you are looking for a color themed computer this would not be the keyboard for you unless I'm not doing something right to change the color to what I want but I do believe the mouse is unchangeable so that would almost have to mean the keyboard is as well. To rate this product I would say I am very satisfied with my product it was just a little hard to know about the colors when you don't read Amazon's print over the product but its fine I'm still happy with it.

",,Arteck,,Bryant L.,"Works great, Excellent customer service, Just a few Cons","Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2016","Pro's
- $20
- Super light weight and at it thickest probably about 2 1/2 - 3 American Quarters in depth
- Personally I use this for my Asus Netbook that runs Windows 10 and on my iPhone 5S just for the sake of testing. (The iPhone usability actually came in handy as I'm using this Keyboard right now to write my product review on through my phone.
- Beautiful array of keyboard colors
- Battery seems to hold a charger very wel although I can not say how long. But I can say that I've used it moderately for about 5-6 hours in one sitting playing a strategy game, so this should be good for almost anything you need to do until you're done doing what you're doing until it needs to be plugged in.

Neutral
- The instructions included were actually better than most products I have seen in the past with devices like this but as always I wish there were more information in regards to troubleshooting connectivity issues.

Con's
- The only indication of how much battery is left is when a blue battery indicator light constantly blinks letting you know that it's going to die soon. I wish when it connected to my Windows 10 device that it told you the exact percentage as I've seen with similar products.
- The backlighting is excellent but to save power it turns off the lighting after 10-15 seconds when not in use. This is a minor inconvience to me as I sometimes like to play an old strategy computer game called, ""Stronghold Crusaders."" The mouse is mostly used but the arrows keys are needed to scroll through the game map. So you can see how this can be annoying. I don't see anywhere in the instructions on if there's a setting to change this feature.

**Updated the Con about ESC key** - Manufacture was prompt in telling me after I wrote this review that pressing the ""Fn+E"" keys after I pair the device would solve this issue. I did as instructed and it solved my ESC button issue listed below. It's also mentioned in the instructions to do so. User error on my part.
**Issue Resolved**- I haven't really tested the ESC button on other programs but I did notice that while playing that game, if I just press the ESC key, it minimizes the game and loads and Internet Explorer window. I have to press the Fn+ESC to get the Menu options I want in the game without it minimizing.
- Lasty, this may be just a fluke thing with the construction of this keyboard I got but I've noticed that I have to press the, ""L"" key with a bit more force as compared to all the other keys.

**Updating this to 5/5 because I respect a company that promptly follows up with user issues even though I wasn't complaining to them. My Con's list other than the ESC button issue still stands though.

I give this a 4/5 only because of the minor Con's I have listed. Other than that this works great. I only hope this has longevity but at $20 if it works for a year I'd still be happy and recommend it.

  Works great, and the back-lighting is great, however when you first turn it on each time it back-lights for a second then you have to fumble in the dark to find they keys to turn the back-light on again, it would be much better if it would remember your preferences and turn back on to how you last had it set.  Also I'm not sure yet if this is a keyboard issue or an Android issue but when I am programming sometimes I press the { key right after a tab it just makes a space so then I have to delete that character and type another letter then { then go back and delete the letter, I will need to hook up another Bluetooth keyboard sometime to see which is causing that issue.Update:  The vendor sent a replacement keybaord saying the first one was defective and not working as expected.  I got the new keyboard connected and the backlighting setting I last used is remembered now which helps a lot when I'm using it on my tablet after my wife has gone to bed.

  Shortly after receiving this, within weeks, characters would repeat in rapid fire no matter what program I was working in. Suddenly, a character would repeat 20-30 times. Sometimes I had to hit Escape to stop it. It's not just letters and numbers, though. Sometimes it's the delete key. You're typing away and suddenly you notice a paragraph is missing.  I contacted amazon and they walked me through a reset, but it didn't help. They said the next step was to contact the manufacturer on the warranty since all the testing took me outside of the time frame in which I could return the keyboard. Rather than going through all that, I just junked it. It's not worth my time anymore to jump through the hoops to replace a $25 keyboard and possibly get another one with the same problem.

  I may have gotten the only one on the shelves with defects.  When I boot my computer with this keyboard I can't select anything with the mouse or keyboard because when I open a menu the ""select"" starts at the top of the menu and runs down to the bottom of the menu, then just repeats.  It took a while to figure out that there's something wrong with the number pad.  I tapped the number two key (down arrow) a couple of times and it stopped.  Sometimes that works but sometimes I have to reboot the computer.  I've never seen anything like this before.  I think its just defective because I discovered that the left shift key is dead.  Doesn't work at all.  It figures if there's one bad item on the shelves I'm the one to get it.  Unfortunately, I tossed the box it came in so I can't send it back.

Corsair K95 RGB Platinum Mechanical Gaming Keyboard - 6x Programmable Macro Keys - USB Passthrough & Media Controls - Fastest Cherry MX Speed - RGB LED Backlit - Black Finish






",$178.06 ,,,A Real Tech,This truly is a Gamer's Keyboard <3 It  (Note: I manually changed to white Corsair Keycaps),"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2018","I am a very picky individual. If you are like me, then you compare compare compare! I previously owned the Razer Huntsman Elite and Corsair K70 Rapidfire along with other Mechanical Keyboards over the past couple years.

Why I prefer this keyboard compared to the Razer & other Corsair Keyboards.

Pros
- I love the texture of the keys. I did change mine from the black to the Corsair white keys. But both the original and Corsair White replacement keys feel so good on the fingertips. I changed mine simply for more color on my desk.
- Volume dials and easily accessible buttons. Nowadays, I must have a volume dial on my keyboards. It's easy to listen to spotify and just hit next, turn up & down the volume. It's also nice being able to see if you have your Numlock on as well as the ability to ""lock, turn off lighting"" directly on the keyboard.
- Functionality. This keyboard offers amazing software. It was simple for me to setup, easy to customize. I love that you can use Corsair Link if you have other Corsair Products. (as I use a Corsair Scimitar Pro RGB for gaming)
- Simplicity & Elegance. This keyboard is just beautiful to look at. I personally prefer the RGB lighting on top compared to my other Razer Hunstman Elite. I just feel it's a more elegant keyboard to look at.
- The material the keyboard is made of is top notch. I love the aluminum frame. When you are installing or moving it. You can just feel the quality of this keyboard.
- Works perfectly after removing/replacing the keycaps. I had issues with Razer keyboards in the past that keys would get stuck after replacing. Not an issue at all with Corsair. Still running strong.
- Lastly - this keyboard is easy to clean. I've used other keyboards that just tends to get anything and everything inside it. I love the raised keys so you can use a little air can and get any dust or particles off the keyboard easy. I also have no problem keeping the face of the keyboard clean.

Con
- The only thing I can come up with that I would improve upon on this keyboard is the wrist rest. I don't care that it doesn't have RGB, I actually prefer it not to but the wrist rest has a slant and doesn't really help prevent me for long hours of gaming or web/graphic design when I spend all day on the PC. I think it needs to be a bit more elevated and less slope. This is easily replaceable though with any wrist rest you prefer. I like the memory foam 1/2 inch to 1"" thick wrist rest for long hours of use to help prevent carpal tunnel.

Photos: I took one of the full keyboard, along with zoomed in larger photos so you could see the design and layout up close and personal.

Changes: Replaced the original keys with CORSAIR Gaming PBT Double-Shot Keycaps Full 104/105-Keyset - White. This is not necessary for those who prefer the black original keys. I replaced mine for visual preference to match other desktop accessories like Yeti White microphone and White AudioEngine speakers.

Length of Use: We purchased the product on Sept. 5th 2018. I prefer to install/use the product before I leave feedback on a product because I want to give a thorough review after use. I use the keyboard for at least 8-12 hours a day and almost 6 days a week.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  I am not a K & M nerd, or I wasn't before I bought this.  I was just looking to try a more ergonomic keyboard and I wondered what the hype was about mechanical keyboards.  I did a little research and it seems that this one is the highest rated overall for an extended keyboard with macros.  I am so impressed that I keep trying to find reasons to boot up and type.Pros:-Key pressing feels great.  The feedback and sound is super gratifying.-The LED's color range, brightness, and programmable display patterns are impressive.-The software capabilities for programming LED's and Macros are wonderful once understood.-The keyboard has no latency whatsoever IMO.-I can't seem to overstate how well made this keyboard feels.  The base is metal and heavy feeling.  The wrist rest rotates, the mounting is easy, the rubber part is held on with a magnetic strip so you can pop it off and clean it easily.  The keys respond well and the switch mechanism feels solid.  There is no play in the keys except to give for typing.  The volume roller bar is solid and moves well.  This keyboard is a wonderfully made device.-This keyboard can sync with other Corsair LED lit devices to have a continuous pattern.Cons:-The software can take a couple of minutes to understand, but I must say that I figure anyone willing to spend close to $200 on a keyboard is probably PC savvy enough to figure out pretty simple programming software.-The macro profiles saved to the device firmware don't allow certain higher functions that are saved to the PC profies such as program launching.  Also certain lighting profiles that you can stack on the PC profiles (such as have a base static color and other moving light profiles on top of the static one) don't save to the hardware firmware.  I understand that some of this is more than likely a storage size issue or the fact that one pc to another will have different program save data paths so it makes sense, I just want to note that it exists.Overall impression: I would recommend this keyboard to anyone with the cash to spend on this wonderfully built and designed piece of hardware.  It has truly been a treat to own and operate this keyboard.

They agreed with me that it needed replacement and just needed my phone number for shipping, which I gladly gave.. Then 2 weeks more go by, I contact them via phone for an update and the person now tells me that they will not replace it. This time due some internal policy they have (no cosmetic returns after 6 months) - I contacted them 3 days after the 6 months by the way.

  Pros: The keyboard is sturdy, doesn't wobble (even when one corner of it is placed on a mousepad), and so far the key letters have not rubbed off. Also the electronic display showing whether caps lock and num lock are engaged is useful.Cons: Sometimes the keyboard takes forever to actually transmit the letters you are typing to your computer. On many occasions (including just now, which is what prompted me to write this review), I will start trying to type and nothing will transmit to my computer. Then eventually all of the letters will come out at once in a weird jumble, and then I am forced to delete it all and try to start the process over. This is incredibly annoying, especially since I am using this keyboard at work. I hate wasting time trying to get my keyboard to work. This was never a problem with my other keyboards. For this reason alone, I would not recommend this keyboard.

  Disclaimer: I'm not a keyboard snob, but my standards are relatively high. This is nice keyboard and mouse combo for the price. Some of the keys are slightly chewy if you press them at an angle, it's mushy overall, and I wouldn't want it as my daily driver. I'm using it for secondary/tertiary purposes, getting hands-on with things that are otherwise inconvenient to run wires to. Had some horrible latency issues with the mouse on Raspberry Pi devices running the NOOBS distribution--these were resolved by adding the parameter 'usbhid.mousepoll=0' to /boot/cmdline.txt.

  So this wireless keyboard worked well for the first few months I used it. However, last week I was using this when I heard a loud POP followed up by a BANG. At first I thought the battery exploded, but after removing the battery door there was nothing I could find. Then I look around to the opposite side of the keyboard and it felt very hot. I'm guessing a capacitor or something exploded. The keyboard doesn't turn on now and I'm outside of my return window. Not going to bother going through the hassle to return this thing I guess.

I wasn't expecting a high end mechanical keyboard feel at this price point, but this far worse than expected.

As bad as the feel of this keyboard is, I probably would have taken my lumps and lived with it, but the keyboard layout is wrong. I didn't pay close enough attention to the photos, because i didn't think I needed to for a full-size keyboard.

  This is a solid keyboard with good lighting functions and solid construction for its price. I expect I will be using it for a very long time. The mechanic clacking sound of the keys is music to my ears.

After a few days I got used to it and found that I could type on it as easily as any of my older keyboards. The fact that it lights up, allowing me to see the keys in the dark is a real boon as well.My only foible is that the lettering on many of the keys have stylistic gaps in them that trip up my brain. Though it is a deliberate styling on the part of the manufacturer, it kind of makes some of the keys look worn, when they really aren't and I imagine would be hell on anyone dealing with something like dyslexia.

HOWEVER, the keyboard is a k120 keyboard. and is excellent if you're on a budget and use your computer heavily.
I've owned 2 k120 keyboards used heavily daily over a span of 4-5 years. (They're cheap, like 10 dollars at ""fallmart"" cheap.)
Which is why I bought this combo. (only needed the keyboard, but wanted the mouse as a spare ""just in case"")
There is nothing fancy about it, it's a standard keyboard which will hold up to a lot of abuse.
(My past two, the letters wore off the keys as I approached 13 months of HEAVY use, I do not need the stickers. and this did not alter function of the keyboard)

As stated, nothing fancy, not mechanical, but it is a sturdy no frills keyboard that does stand the test of time.
(An average user could probably have this keyboard working fine for 4 years. my average life span of generic keyboards is 3 months. I get about 2 years out of this model.)
This is my budget friendly go-to daily use input device. (I live at my PC...)
Past two k120 keyboards I've owned, reason for replacement was the metal spring bar under the spacebar would stick/fail. (I used a temporary work around until I got the new keyboard by using a number key from the keypad as a temporary space bar.)

It's a good keyboard.  However, the keys are a bit too easy to press.  If you are not used to it, you will be prone to making mistake by pressing the extra letter or two in the beginning.  But it is all matter of getting used to.  I hoped for a bit firmer keys.  But for the price, I'm happy with it.  I only had it for a week, so I can't give you a full review on durability.  But the material feels like the good grade.  I'm a 46-year-old clinical reviewer typing reports all day in the morning and running a business in the afternoon.

I've been looking to switch to a wired keyboard as wireless keyboards seem to have signal and/or connection issues frequently at my office (too many people with wireless equipment possibly). It has the standard traditional keyboard layout (especially on the Insert/Home/Page Up area), which I like. It also has the standard sized function keys without any frills, which is perfect for developing code. The keys themselves feel a little cheap (light?) even compared to other Logitech keyboards that I own. I have one main gripe with this keyboard and it's that the Window key combinations don't register when you type really fast (I've tried it with Alt with the same issues). More specifically, I am using this on a Mac and I've set up the keyboard language change to be Cmd-<space>. However, if I type really fast, it misses it (e.g. it doesn't change the language). I haven't had problem with this combination even with el-cheapo no-name keyboard. This is rather frustrating since my job requires me to switch the keyboard language constantly.

  The keyboard and mouse are both very lightweight and perfect for carrying around. The keyboard is slightly bigger than my iPad Mini 4 and slightly smaller than my Macbook Air keyboard (although the keys are the same size - just the spacing between the keys). The keyboard can be easily paired via Bluetooth for my iPad and Mac, so I can easily switch between them. The keyboard requires charging via a USB cable. You can charge it via your computer. The keyboard also lights up, and there's different settings of how bright you want your keys to be backlit. This definitely makes typing on the iPad extremely easier, and it allows me to raise my Mac on a stand when I work - serving multi-functions!The mouse is powered via an AA battery, which isn't included. The mouse is easier paired via Bluetooth to my iPad and laptop.This product is perfect in making your life easier working on your iPad. You can easily stick it in a tote bag or backpack.

  This is great. Ever since I bought a laptop holder, i thought the stand holder is too high for me to type with the laptop keyboard almost on my neck level. This wireless keyboard and mouse are very helpful for my situation. if you dont move the mouse and press keys, they would go to sleep mode, you just have to press your keyboard and lift your mouse. Then the computer will promote icons for successful connections. The mouse is not rechargeable, and is not very responsive if you have bad internet connection, at least it happened to me a few times. Overall, I love this product!

   Okay I will start this off by stating, yes it does feel cheap....but it is cheap so I guess that would be a given yeah? Outside of that, the keyboard isn't huge which I like, with small hands it's easier to reach all the keys in a timely fashion while I'm playing games. I take a long time to decide what I want when I'm seeking new items so I needed something to hold me over until then. But honestly this set isn't the worst and the keys are quiet. Which is good since now I won't have to hear that I'm waking the other half up with my clickity click clicks. Keys are on there very well and you shouldn't feel like you're going to break it unless you're an angry gamer and pound hard on the board. The mouse fits nicely as well is responsive with no lag or hiccups. Now the LED lights are well lit up when it's dark and decently lit up when lights are on. If you've a hard time seeing yours perhaps increase the brightness to them. All in all this works for what I needed it for. And knowing what I was buying prior I've no complaints about the product. I've spent over 100$ on a keyboard more then once and some decided to die after only a couple of months of use. Point is, just because something costs more doesn't make it better and just because something is cheap doesn't make it worthless. Sometimes faulty or bad products regardless the cost is just bad. So don't let some reviews steer you away. If you need something now, then this will work out for you. If you get and don't like it, ship it right back no harm no loss. Simple~

I really like the feel of the Rii. The keys are well separated and have a nice positive feedback. Because of the way the keys are separated I can find keys like the arrow keys by feel without looking down, and if I do have to look down, the back lighting makes it really easy to find a key. I really hated the feel of the Logitech keyboard and it caused me to make lots of typing mistakes because the keys were not well defined. Also, the control key only registered if you pressed it on one side of the key. I use the control key a lot for copy (<ctrl>-C) and paste (<ctrl>-V), so this was a big pain. I have no such problems with the Rii keyboard. The Rii keyboard is wired, but this really isn't a big issue. I can still use the mouse from the wireless desktop no problem. Also, having a wired keyboard makes it easier to get into the BIOS when the system boots. It would take some time for the wireless keyboard to be recognized. The backlighting looks really cool!

Update 2017-11-21: The LEDs on this keyboard periodically go out. At first, I thought the keyboard was defective but if you unplug the USB cable and plug it back in, the LEDs come back on. This is a bit of a pain, but I will live with it because I love this keyboard so much: it looks really cool, is easy to see in the dark and is a joy to type on.

Update 2017-12-26: Boy do I feel stupid! I discovered that there is a rather obvious button on this keyboard that turns the LEDs on and off. I had been inadvertently hitting it and turning off the LEDs. Equipped with this knowledge, I can give this keyboard a confident 5 stars.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$19.99 ,Rii,Gaming,Reign Beaux,"Works great on my Linux system... definitely a great keyboard at any price, EXCEPTIONAL at less than $15!","Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2017","If not all keyboards are 'equal to' each other, this was definitely a 'greater than' all other backlit keyboards I have tried on my Linux system. To begin with, several of the others I have tried were designed specifically for Microsoft or Apple devices and any supporting features or ""drivers"" were only available on those systems. While most would retain the basic functionality of a keyboard, (i.e. you could type the characters on the keyboard into the software of your choice), some would not. My prior keyboard cost well over $40.00 on sale but the led feature was unavailable without enabling it deep in the system through a command line code using XSET. The keyboard would then light up but the numerical keypad was disabled...

There are NO such problems with this keyboard in Linux. Just plug it in and begin using it after your computer boots. (I'm old school I guess, I always plug any input devices prior to booting so I can not attest to it being ""hot swappable"".)
The keyboard looks great when lit and the characters are easily discernable while not being to large and ""garish"". The size of the illuminated letters on each key are aesthetically pleasing and in well lit situations does not require a backlight to determine the which character/key you are pressing but are still not quite as clear as a non-lit keyboard with printed characters in high contrast. This effect is the same for all backlit keyboards I have tried so far and appears to me to be the limitations of the current materials available for molding the plastic keycaps in a light dispersing plastic. The optional ""breathing"" effect is nice but I will seldom use this feature. The ""sleep"" function I have not yet discovered how to initiate on my system. The accompanying ""User Manual"" is sparse on any instructions with the exception of a small list of key combinations for using the FN + Function keys, (F1-F12), to control the multimedia functions of most operating systems and how to control the led keyboard itself.
The light function of this keyboard is ""onboard"" eliminating the necessity of any extra operating system driver or software support.
The keys have a nice tactile feel to them and are positioned well for extended use without discomfort. The board itself, while lightweight, has a substantial feel which leads to an impression of quality surpassing other keyboards I have tried which cost much more.
If you are looking for a well built but inexpensive backlit keyboard, I feel that this is a very safe investment for almost anyone.
There is one more caveat, I am not a gamer so I can not attest to how well this keyboard would function as such. However, if you are firing off a quick email to your mother, or beginning the next great American novel ...",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  First time owning a RGB Mechanical keyboard. I am building my first PC and decided to try this keyboard out. The keys are actually more quiet than most mechanical keyboards I've researched and played with at the store, so there isn't much of a ""Clicky"" sound which actually works for me. The mouse that comes with this package has a very nice RGB feature. Only downside is that the keyboard doesn't have any different RGB modes, just an on/off button on the keyboard.

  As a budget solution, this is definitely a solid choice. The mouse and keyboard function well such that I don’t really notice them. That’s a good thing, as you want the user experience to be seamless. That said, not a huge fan of the way RGB was done here. The colors are static and not addressable. That means that (with the keyboard and bottom of the mouse) you are stuck with rainbow puke, and only can vary the breathing mode of part of the mouse and the color of the logo on it. Allowing uniform color would be preferable. That said, the construction is excellent and the metal used in the keyboard makes it feel chonkey in the good way

Razer Huntsman Gaming Keyboard: Fastest Keyboard Switches Ever - Clicky Optical Switches - Customizable Chroma RGB Lighting - Programmable Macro Functionality - Quartz Pink

The box also makes you think it'll be a much cuter, paler pink. However the real product is a rather barbie-pink color. Which is a shame but not a deal breaker.

The lack of typical slots for keys make it easier to keep clean and offers a more modernized, simplistic look. The fact that it's so minimalistic is one of the reasons why I purchased it.

+ High Quality and durable chassis
+ Opto-Mechanical switches are as advertised
+ Fully Programmable RGB compatible with other Razer devices
+ Tactile and Audible keys
+ Programmable Macros
+ 2 year Warranty

Cons:
- Very Expensive
- Keys are insanely loud
- Razer Synapse/Cortex software ( for some users )
- No USB Throughput unlike the BlackWidow

My Review:
I bought the Razer Huntsman in Rose Quartz pink, and my primary use for it is gaming. My experience so far has been phenomal! It features Fully Programmable RGB that is compatible with my Razer Mouse through the included software. The Keys feature ""Opto-Mechanical"" design, and you're getting the best of both worlds with them. The instant you press a key past it's actuation point you get a tactile and audible sensation and that tells you the keyboard just sent a signal through at the speed of light. This keyboard really takes as many factors of input lag out of the question so if you play e-sport titles as I do you will really be able to tell the difference.

Ergonomics: The key caps are a little large, but can be replaced with any Cherry MX conpatible key-caps. That being said, you only have two options of inclinations through the two stage lifts on the rear portion of the underside. If you're hands are long you'll probably need to use a Palm rest ( such as the one included in the Elite Edition ).

",$59.99 ,,,Rachael Edwards,Improvement over 2.4 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2020","About a year ago a friend of mine got the wireless keyboard and mouse and I fell in love. I bought a pair for myself a while back and when they just came out with a bluetooth version I knew I had to have it.

I have a dock that doesn't play well with Wireless 2.4G peripherals without a range extender so bluetooth peripherals are the way to go. I loved the feel of the keyboard and mouse that I was willing to put up with the old pair, but the moment Jelly Comb came out with the bluetooth set I jumped on that boat.

The keyboard feels like a laptop keyboard to me and I really enjoy the feeling of those. It also includes a silicone key cover that you can leave on to type which serves two purposes 1. To keep dust and stuff out of your keyboard 2. To quiet your typing so the clacking of the already quiet keys doesn't annoy you or anyone else around you.

This version has an improved mouse as now both the keyboard and mouse can be charged and don't require batteries.

The best part is that you can still use it through a wireless 2.4G connection if you like. It also has 2 bluetooth channels. Channel 1 allows you to hookup the keyboard and mouse to Windows and Android Machines. Channel 2 allows you to connect to compatible Apple devices such as Mac computers.

I was super easy to set up (after I read the instructions about which channel is for which device) and both the keyboard and mouse work perfectly. I am super happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a decent keyboard that feels solid and smooth and a mouse with almost noiseless buttons and a slim profile.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",,,,Tori Sullivan,"In my quest to find the perfect keyboard, this one hits just a few strokes short","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2020","For most people this keyboard will be great. I've personally determined to give myself the best typing experience I can reasonably afford, however due to the pandemic that has turned into me buying keyboards on Amazon to test them out. So if you're just landing on this review and want a keyboard that looks, feels, and works great, you will not be dissatisfied.

---

That being said, I'd like to share my thoughts as to why this wasn't a home run for me.
I was really hoping that this would be the one I settle with, because I absolutely Love love LOVE Arteck's portable bluetooth keyboard for using with my phone or surface pro. It's really close, but I think there's just a handful of things I don't like, just enough to put this into the return pile:

-The gentle arch - I get why it's there, and I'm sure some people may greatly enjoy it, but for me it throws me off. I'm used to the keys being flat all straight across and my fingers predict more accurately when they are, this seems to be more of a readability feature than an ergonomic improvement.

-The overall feeling is lower quality than I'd like, which seems contrary to the reviews that pushed me over the line into making the purchase. Compared to the plastic of the Arteck portable bluetooth keyboard which is incredibly solid feeling and a joy to type on, This one feels cheap at first touch and not worth the money. I'd have expected a $20 keyboard to feel like this, not the $40-something I bought it for.

-The Stainless Steel looks and feels like plastic to me, and any push or press onto a non-keyed surface of the keyboard elicits a creaky plasticky noise that bothers me way more than I'd like it to. So it's a definite reduction of one star for an unexpectedly cheap feeling build vs. what's been advertised.

The mouse - Way too sensitive vs. other mice I've used, it flicks across the screen super fast (which may be useful to some) I also have to click several times to get it to wake up after going to sleep, vs most just takes a click or a wiggle.
I also hate the ""ARTECK"" blasted right across the face of the mouse, I prefer more subtle branding.

The main positive note I can say is that I was nervous about it being a rechargeable keyboard and draining on battery quickly but it's actually held up well in that department. I've only given it one charge in the past couple weeks I've owned it. I also like the shape of the keys but I wish that they had a more springy action, again like their portable bluetooth keyboard. I was really overall just hoping they had that little keyboard's typing engineering in a full sized keyboard as well!

Anyway, That's about everything I can think of, hope this was useful to anyone looking for some more in depth specifics on this keyboard!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

  The keyboard layout is horrible.  The main problem is the enter key that is almost impossible to use when you type rapidly.  It's different from the standard enter key and has the backslash key right at the spot where the enter key should be.  It drove me crazy from the very start, and I couldn't get used to it after several hours of typing.  Whenever I tried to hit the enter key, instead of getting a return I got a backslash.  I suppose someone thought that this change of keys would be a good idea, but in my opinion, it was a terrible idea for people who touch-type.The feel of the keys and the clicking sound are also annoying, but if it weren't for that stupid enter key arrangement, I probably would have put up with it.  Fortunately, Amazon is very good regarding returns.  I guess Amazon's enter key is positioned correctly so it's easy to get a return instead of a backslash - just a bit of humor on a very frustrating day.

1) The letters on the keys wear off pretty quickly, I noticed this after a few days.

2) The enter key is terrible, it is too thin at the bottom so I'm always pressing the backslash key when trying to hit enter, and sometimes hit both, which causes some annoyance when using the terminal.

3) The power key is right next to the F12 key, I constantly use the F12 key to open and close my drop-down terminal, this is a serious problem when I accidentally hit the power key while trying to type quickly. This could be fixed by placing the power/sleep/wake-up keys top-center of the keyboard, and this would look better too.

4) Due to adding the power/sleep/wake-up buttons where they are, the other keys that are there are pushed down the board toward the arrow keys. This is a minor issue for me since I've mostly gotten used to it, but it's really annoying if yo go to press Insert only to press print screen which, on my system, takes a screenshot and puts it in my Pictures directory.

Corsair K95 RGB Platinum XT Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit RGB LED, Cherry MX RGB Blue, Black






",$199.99 ,Gaming,,S. Cook,Premium price. Poor quality control.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 12, 2020","A mechanical keyboard with per-key RGB, dedicated media controls, dedicated macro keys, double-shot keycaps, 10-key, no ridiculously over-the-top ""gamer"" styling, and MX blues. This is my unicorn. I can't adequately express my disappointment.

My first purchase has a USB passthrough that only intermittently works. On top of that, there is a very loud metallic ping. It's not a problem with the switches, nor the keycaps like Corsair's support suggests. I sent for a replacement. The volume wheel on the replacement sticks and the pinging is even worse. I was even okay with the LEDs being dimmer than my current K95, but these problems are unacceptable at this price point.

This is not the first time I've run into quality control failures with Corsair keyboards. When the RGB Strafe first became available with MX blues I jumped on it. I went through 3 or 4 boards, all with multiple keys that were completely unusable. Mushy spacebar that would not spring back up, other keys with the same behavior. I ended up simply going with MX browns instead and finally got a board that worked properly. Even my current K95 Platinum with MX browns, I'm not 100% happy with. The volume wheel has been off since day one. Rolls to a point and then 'pop' like it gets stuck on something. I baby my electronics so it's not like I broke it over time. At least the keys all work and there is no pinging when I type.

I think I'm just done with Corsair peripherals. When the time comes that I need to replace this board, I will just go with something else. Maybe a Razer. At a $200 price point for a keyboard, I expect perfection which this product does NOT deliver. Funny thing is, I would pay even more for that perfection if someone built it.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  Corsair kind of makes me sick with this keyboard.  I expect a lot more from a company like Corsair and I have owned many of their products.  BEWARE before buying this.  I took this brand new keyboard out of the box and plugged it in.  I must say it looks beautiful and feels great under my fingers.  I went through a lot of trouble to connect this to my keyboard.  The cord is very think and has two USB ports that must be plugged in.  My computer is 6 feet high and the cable routing is a challenge so I only like to do things once.  I got it all setup properly and downloaded the new Corsair software.  While setting it up the first thing I see is an ""update software"" button.  I always like to have the newest and best drivers and software running so of course I click that.  Suddenly, the key board DIED.  dead out no lights no response.  I bricked the keyboard, from their software update.  I go through quite on order, unplugging and plugging it back in, rebooting my computer, the whole 9 yards.  So now I have to undo everything I did and plug the old keyboard back in to get on the internet to see what I did.  Something I wanted to avoid as I said my computer is high and not easily accessible.  After some time of searching I find out, this is a KNOWN issue for this keyboard and Corsair refuses to acknowledge or correct it.  Shame shame on you!  why would you put your customers through this?  and how many RGA's do you have to go through from people who arent skilled enough to search this, download the correct bin file, replace it on the keyboard memory and REBOOT the keyboard?  which is another thing, the reboot process is just insane to have us hold in a tiny button in with a pin while trying to plug and unplug TWO USB cables.  even if most computers arent 6 feet in the air.  This is a known issue, many many people on the forums have had the same problems,  your software is bricking YOUR own $200 keyboard.  fix the problem corsair and stop telling people its not your fault.  Liars make me sick, lying companies are worse.  anyone with google can verify this situation and you deny it and refuse to fix it.  I would expect this from a $30 Chinese knock off, not you.  Your software is crappy and overly complicated.  Many times I have had my lighting freeze and programming the G keys is just overly cumbersome.  I  am so disappointed that a wonderful and well built keyboard from a top notch company is ruined by the software experience.  Please get your game together.  Until then I would recommend people consider these issues and possibly avoid this keyboard.

  I have the K400 Logitech which had stopped working and so I replaced it wit this Arteck, which works great!  I did replace the AAA alkaline with nimh and since it has auto sleep mode conserves battery use. You'll love this keyboard for typing;the feel is excellent and the key letters are visible. A HIGH QUALITY keyboard in my opinion. I did research how to reset the K400 Logitech I replaced and found it did reset by pressing three or more keys for 30 seconds switched off; so it did revive.

If you plan doing any amount of typing you'll appreciate how nice the Artech keyboard is. I'm adding back in that for most uses I use the Logitech K 400 most of the time for surfing and the extra handy left click button on the upper left of the K400 is a feature I love and it light and easy to use, up to you, I have both with more than one machine and actually you can plug the senders for both in one machine and use either keyboard.

Razer BlackWidow Elite Mechanical Gaming Keyboard: Yellow Mechanical Switches - Linear & Silent - Chroma RGB Lighting - Magnetic Wrist Rest - Dedicated Media Keys & Dial - USB Passthrough






",$129.99 ,,,NTLDR,False Advertising and Razer's Synapse 3 Software Turns This Keyboard From a 5-Star to a 1-Star,"Reviewed in the United States on April 20, 2019","I got this keyboard in the evening, unboxed it, tested it, and then requested return the next morning. It's a very nice keyboard. Hardware quality it pretty decent. It could have been a 5-star rated keyboard. I'm making it a 1-star because the CONS (software) defeat all the good things about this mechanical keyboard.

PROS:
* Pretty-self explanatory. I'm not going to elaborate much on the advantages/positive attributes. For the most part, it speaks for itself. Just watch any YouTube video review.

CONS:
* Cable management can be better. Wire does not stick to it's molded path, but deficiencies in software/drivers are much more serious, which leads me to....
* Synapse 3 software is a bloated mess. About ~250 MB to download, depending on what modules you install AND it requires creation of an online ""cloud account"" just to configure lighting, settings, and so on.
* Razer advertises an on-board memory feature where you can save up to 4 profiles created into synapse right into the keyboards internal memory. In theory, this lets you switch between profiles without Synapse on other computers. In theory, this means you can change settings on-the-fly on other OSes. In practice, on-board profiles DO NOT include color/lighting schemes. Only macros. Internal memory is limited and pretty much non-existent. False advertising on the part of Razer.
* This keyboard DEPENDS on Synapse software at almost all times. If you log-out of your cloud account, you lose your settings and it goes to factory default RGB breathe mode. If the Synapse process crashes or closes out, you lose your settings and you get reverted to factory default. Most settings don't get saved to the Razer Blackwidow Elite's internal memory. However, if you re-start or log-in to the Synapse software, your settings get restored.
* Dependency on Synapse software implies poor portability. Good luck connecting this keyboard to your friend's computer or your work computer. You'll have to install Synapse.
* Dependency on Synapse also means you're stuck with Windows. Razer doesn't even offer a Mac version. You're stuck with Windows. No Mac support and certainly no Linux support.
* To be fair, there is an open-source project called OpenRazer that reverse engineers Razer's hardware and software so that Razer devices can work on Linux. However, at the time of this review, the OpenRazer project team has no official support for this model and it's been out for almost a year. I'm under the impression Razer complicates interoperability.
* Seriously, considering how bad the software is, you might be better off with another brand of hardware like SteelSeries, DasKeyboard, WASD and others.
* Again, the Synapse software is so bad that I'm vividly reminded of how a printer OEM came out with good printers, but defeated their own hardware products with terrible software and drivers totaling 250-500MB in size.
* As they say, your mileage may vary greatly. But for my use case, circumstances, and workflow this is a terribly crippled product, which is why I'm returning it ASAP to resolve buyer's remorse.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  This keyboard is a dream. Colorful, nice feel, intelligently laid-out. Why the one-star?

Why is it corporate America feels entitled to know everything about you, sell your information, track you, market merchandise and make you pay for the privilege of giving up one's privacy, all in the name of ""providing you a service""?  ... and do you think they could think of a way for you to not have to do so?

",$129.99 ,,,Patricia Ann Terbrueggen,Overall an amazing keyboard with some minor gripes,"Reviewed in the United States on February 4, 2019","
  This is by far the best keyboard I have ever owned, as every key is amazingly satisfying to click, without a ludicrous asking price, as I think you get your money's worth. The huntsman elite is obviously the keyboard people are gonna compare, and this keyboard is without a doubt better for the price, with USB and audio passthrough, an extremely durable chassis, and most importantly a fantastic, satisfying typing experience with the Razer green switches. The wristwrest is not the absolute best compared to others like the one included on the ornata, as it's not as big or cushioned, but it's still a fantastic wristrest. Overall even compared to other notable competitors like the Corsair k95, in my opinion if you are a gamer/typist who enjoys a simple yet satisfying reassuring click this keyboard will not disappoint. Also while I'm at it I want to share that I think these are better than cherry mx blues, as these are in my opinion better for gaming, you can look up the specs of both keys to compare but these keys are clearly the two most similar. I had a Razer ornata before this keyboard which was a very respectable keyboard for typing and speed, but I wanted to get a mechanical, and this checked all the boxes. My only real gripe with this keyboard is ease of use, even though more advanced users familiar with razers software and function layout, some new people will easily get confused and won't be able to get the most functionality out of their brand new keyboard. Overall if you can get this keyboard on sale it would be an absolute steal, but I could easily recommend it at retail price as well. If you want THE keyboard, this one will most likely do it for you. I have had this keyboard for about a month or so now with zero issues. While I may sound extremely positive because I do think this keyboard is fantastic, I will be giving it a 4 star because my media controls are not programmed correctly or something. They work, but they do not pause, play, go back and forth on tracks etc, although the media dial does work, although this may be an individual issue please keep in mind the media dial does seem to act as a c key or other depending on the game and which direction I move it, it's very wierd but I'm almost certain it's a software issue as the hardware itself works flawlessly. Besides this I have had this keyboard for about a month and had zero problems or complaints. Highly recommended! I will try to update this review if I have any problems or if I fix the media keys issue. EDIT: The media keys issue has basically resolved itself, but my W key started to have some issues with not always registering. I will keep it at 4 stars because I still love this keyboard and a resolder seems to have fixed it? But if I hadn't done that I probably would have had to try to get a warranty on it if I even could. Just a little update for some people who may be curious, but this is after easily 30 million plus clicks because I am a heavy user, still not what razer advertised though. Didn't completely stop working, just had some issues now and then with the w key, this is most likely and individual problem though. Still worth it due to it having multiple sales for around 135 dollars, which is still an absolute killer deal for this keyboard. Keep in mind, I still use this keyboard, its still the best keyboard I currently own even with its issues that come and go. Have had it for about a year and a half now.

",,FELICON,Gaming,Tribhuwan Singh,Light and amazingly good mechanical keyboard and mouse,"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2020","I absolutely loved this product. I've been gaming on these devices day night and I should say that these are way efficient than many other in the market. I play Valorant a lot so my perception would be slightly biased:

The mechanical feel is absolutely worth it.

This is very convenient having one receiver for both keyboard and mouse.

RGB adds an extra touch, however, there is only one variation of RGB for the keyboard but you can change the brightness of it while it changes frequently in the mouse.

The mouse pad is smooth and has a facility to change DPI at three different levels for the mouse is something I rarely see nowadays.

Battery life is really good. I play for 5-6 hours daily and didn't face any problem till now. Although, it is not capable of fast charging neither you would get any adapter with the package.

Anti-ghosting function is amazing and it never failed me while playing nor while working.

Both the keyboard and mouse are very light built and are of plastic made.

Pros:
The mouse fits in my hand nicely, the movement is smooth and the clicks feel nice.
The backlit colors are a neat feature.
Having a single dongle for both is great for utilizing USB ports.

Cons:
The product feels cheap to the touch.
I would say the keys feel like a cherry MX black style except for longer press distance and less satisfying.
The description says ""This upgraded wireless keyboard&mouse combo is made of sturdy and durable aluminum alloy brushed panel"" unless the panel is inside, this whole thing is made of cheap light plastic.
The paint job on the keyboard is terrible. you can see the overspray and some of the keys didn't get fully painted
the switches on both the mouse and keyboard are small and cheaply made. I can actually feel the mouse switches on the bottom touching the mouse pad at times.

I give this product 3 stars because it works as described. the mouse looks good all lit up and the feel of the mouse is nice. The keyboard needs improvement.

  This product comes with everything you need including a mousepad, wireless mouse, and keyboard. The mouse pad has an awesome design. It is thin and there are no troubles moving the mouse around. For the wireless mouse, it glows and is lightweight. The buttons are not loud when clicking, which is perfect for when you play games late at night. As for the keyboard, it is wired, however it has a backlit light so I can see the keys when it is dark. The sounds when tapping on the keyboard aren’t too loud but it does have some volume to it. The keys itself is about half an inch thick, so it is not exactly thin. It has 2 tabs in the back where you can lift the keyboard up so it will be easier to see the keys. The buttons work perfectly. No lag. And finally, the best thing about this is that it does not require too many wires, so you can have a clean and mostly wire-free gaming set up.

Apple Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad (Wireless, Rechargable) (US English) - Space Gray






",$129.99 ,,,C,FINALLY! Wireless 10-Key for the Mac!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2017","Apple FINALLY listened to its business customers and brought us the Magic Keyboard WITH 10-Key. I've been a Mac user for years now and always wanted to be able to use a wireless keyboard. Unfortunately, after trying both the Logitech K750 for Mac and the Kanex MultiSync Aluminum Mac Keyboard with lackluster results, I figured it was a lost cause as Apple's Magic Keyboard didn't include the 10-Key. Then last week I learned about this one and picked one up. Here are my thoughts:

Pros:
1) It has the solid look and feel that the original Magic Keyboard has. That's a huge plus as others I've tried have been flimsy.
2) The internal battery is rechargeable via the Lightning port on the back. That's perfect since it's the same cable used by the iPhone.
3) It's very lightweight - only about 1lb.
4) Since it's made by Apple, all of the function keys operate like they're supposed to (that's not the case with aftermarket keyboards as they're not allowed to access those parts of MacOS).
5) It doesn't have the keystroke lag that other aftermarket keyboards have.
6) It doesn't have the wake-from-sleep issue that other aftermarket keyboards have.

Cons:
1) It took way to long for Apple to release this
2) The price. MSRP of $130 is steep. But, being an Apple user, I wasn't surprised.
3) It's only available in the aluminum/white color scheme. Since the vast majority of Apple computers are the MacBook, it would be nice if it were available in aluminum/black (as well as the other new MacBook color schemes).

Overall, I'm very pleased with mine and plan to buy more as needed.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

• Recharges with the supplied lighting cable (I don't care how long the battery does or does not last because my trackpad needs recharging a lot sooner than the keyboard and I just charge them both when the trackpad needs charging).

CON'S:
• It is not backlit (you can see in the pics I have my own motion sensing lights to backlight it).

",$129.99 ,,,Mark,Great keyboard for Mac users,"Reviewed in the United States on June 23, 2018","Overall, I really like the keyboard but it's far from ""perfect"". Although, everyone has different tastes for what they want in a keyboard.

It has the typical excellent Apple quality. I'm so happy they finally released a full size keyboard with number pad that is Bluetooth. I recently upgraded to a 2017 MacBook Pro that only has USB-C connectors. So, the more wireless devices I use with it, the better. Otherwise I generally deal with multiple dongles since not too many devices yet have USB-C cables.

I've used non-Apple bluetooth keyboards before but they almost always are ""Windows"" keyboards and thus have different ""command"" keys and the function keys don't work to adjust things like brightness, media playback, etc. So, it's nice using an external keyboard from which I can still control those things.

It does not have replaceable batteries so that's kind of a bummer but the internal battery seems to last a long time. I've had it for a couple months now and haven't had to charge it yet.

A few things are keeping me from giving this a full 5 star rating.
* I wish it had flip out feet so you could adjust the angle. It sits almost flat. It works ok but ideally I'd like a little more of an angle.
* The keys - I'll admit they are better than the new keys on the MacBook Pro, but still not the best. Ideally I'd like nice mechanical keys with some travel to them.
* Backlighting - I know this would kill the battery faster, but it would be nice to have the option. I like to work in a rather dark room and having backlit keys would be great.

These are more a personal preference in a keyboard than an issue with this keyboard itself. Right now, it seems to be the best keyboard (for me) to use with my MacBook Pro.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I've had 4 keyboards, starting with the Razer Blackwidow Chroma, then the Corsair Strafe RGB, then the Logitech G Pro, and now the GK61. After researching about custom keyboards, I figured this would be a good base to get started. This board is made using the GK61 PCB from ePathBuy, which means you can customize to your liking beyond just the keycaps. For example, I found another case for this PCB that I will be placing this board into. I have yet to try out the hot swappable switch feature, but you can find Gateron Optical switches in 70 packs for less than $20. The software for this keyboard is garbage. If you can read Chinese you might be able to figure it out, but I still don't know how to change the static lights from green to another color (I keep the lights off anyway). All in all, this keyboard is fantastic for the aspiring custom keyboard junkie like myself.

For $50, finding a hot swappable 60% RGB Mechanical Keyboard is just mind boggling! I’ve had this keyboard for a few weeks now, and I must say I’m very impressed with it. The first thing that stood out to me when I used this keyboard was that the Gateron Optical Switches are SOOO SMOOTH. Seriously though, they’re smoother than the regular Gateron Switches (Non-optical) and they put Cherry Mx Switches in the dirt. This keyboard also comes with software to add macros, change lighting, etc. However, I’ve been told that it is complete garbage.

The features that this keyboard provides for the price highly outweighs it’s garbage software, which is why I’m giving this 5 stars. The keyboard is only hot swappable with Gateron Optical Switches that you can purchase on epathbuy.

The build quality of this keyboard is solid as well, having a backplate made entirely out plastic, it still feels like a premium product. The keyboard comes with feet rests on the back and this allows the keyboard to not move around at all when you’re typing or gaming.

My only con is that it only comes with 2 switch options and doesn’t come with more switch options such as the Gateron Optical Reds, Blacks, Yellows, Silvers, etc.

",$64.99 ,HK Gaming,Gaming,Luis Oscar Thevenin Mejia,Exactly what you get for the price.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 12, 2019"," I will start this review saying that overall I like this keyboard, this is my first mechanical keyboard and I will keep for a while, the thing is that I have tried in stores more of the high-end keyboard and this is not perfect. So it need's some improvement's so it could be perfect, this will be based on the typing and gaming experience.

The box includes the keyboard, USB to Type C cable, key popper, switch popper and a manual.

The Type C cable is braided and looks nice with the gold ends, nice for the price.

The keyboard has a plastic case that even that when I ordered I thought it was going to be cheap, surprisingly I like how it looks and doesn't look cheap at all, having the option of the removable Type C connection is good, but talking about the exterior the little thing that it could have is a adjustable feet because it just makes it more adaptable for all people .The PBT keycaps let the RGB through and the font isn't terrible as some others keys so the are good and showing all the functions that the keyboard has.

Now the typing experience is great but not more than that because of the stabilizers (that I will talk about them in a moment) they are glued to the plate and keys like shift and enter feels different and not that smooth, it could be mine in specific.

In gaming is not that important as typing because writing you will need almost all keys but the features for games are great, press as much keys at the same time as you want, fast response time and then the switches that you pick, great for gaming.

I don't have anything bad to say about the switches, I ordered the blue switches and work as expected. Even that it says hot swappable, they only work with optical switches, this could be a bummer for some but I would say to give it a trie to the gaterons.

The RGB is just not good, if you expect to use anything out of the basic colors like red, blue, green, etc. They will just look horrible and some cases will not be that color at all.

The software has a lot of customization like breathing, wave effects and could set each key as the color you like even creating your own. All the functions that you can set in it surprised me adding to the ones that you can see in the picture of the key caps, you can change them all and set each key for something different including with the function key excluding the ñ or any other funcions from the spanish keyboard. You have three profiles that you can change with the in board memory of the keyboard and one with the software open. But you will need to know some chinese or pass a lot of time trying the options like I did, look for the link putting in google GK61 software and you will find it.

So the stabilizers for some reason are glued to the board as you can see in the pictures and it feels cheap and looks gross, this is my most big complaint having aesthetically and feeling downsides with overall the experience of typing and gaming.

So this 50$ keyboard being the first one that I own with the pros and cons that it has, I could say that I recommend it if you only have a 50$ budget for this, of you have more than 80$ just look for another option, it isn't terrible just that it could be better with little details.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

The software.. oh dear. You have to google how to find the software, They don't even tell you about the software besides one leaflet in the box saying ""compatible with example.exe""

It's all dominatnly Chinese, they didn't even both doing a a full English translation of everything. There JUST enough english to scrape by, but the learning is all on you.

Try to change a color? good luck, you have to figure out how to make a profile, then try to choose a color. HOPE that when you press save (if you find that button) that the color actually saves. In order to get a color of Aqua blue, no effects, I had to 'trick' the software, but making multiple 'frames' of that one color, do the hokey pokey with it, save and hope it stayed put.

Once I figured out how to apply it... No aqua blue, just black. and now shift doesn't work.

So I gave up for today and stuck with its default colors (the whole reason I got this and not another was because it included RGB to match my desk.)

Wireless Keyboard Mouse, Jelly Comb 2.4GHz Ultra Slim Full Size Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo for Windows, Laptop, Notebook, PC, Desktop, Computer (White and Gold)






",$46.99 ,,,Scott A,Almost perfect - Some details need attention,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2018"," Edit 2/15/18: Received the set Jan. 10th and charged the keyboard fully the next day. I'm typing on it right now and have yet to charge it a second time. That's over a month of pretty regular usage (and stellar standby battery management). I don't even see the status light letting me know it's getting low yet. Obviously, if all you're doing all day long is typing, your usage is going to vary. However, this is pretty darn good in my opinion!

Original Review: I'll start off with this - the keyboard is super comfortable to type on, and it's 100% responsive. Hasn't missed any keystrokes yet. I think I'm in the minority of folks with this, but I much prefer the experience of a laptop keyboard. However, because I tend to plug my laptop into a much larger monitor when I'm getting serious work done, that means I need an external keyboard. I've been searching for a long time trying to find a full-sized one with the kind of shallow, responsive keys that my laptop has. This Jelly Comb keyboard ABSOLUTELY delivers on that. As for the mouse, it is definitely shallow, as other reviewers have notes several times. If you're used to a mouse that fits perfectly into the curve of your hand, it might take some getting used to, but it's really not that bad at all. Pair this with the shockingly quiet mouse clicks, and the shape is most definitely worth getting used to.

Now, for the less satisfying bits. I really wish I could give this package 5 stars. I really do, but because it doesn't totally deliver on what's advertised, I just can't. The seller's mistake is in marketing it as ""whisper quiet"" typing and mouse. While it's definitely much quieter than an old-fashioned mechanical keyboard, I don't know that it's overall super quiet - especially the keyboard. For instance, while the majority of keys are a little more subdued, there's is a bit of a metallic-sounding ""clack"" to them. The spacebar, however... is incredibly loud compared to the rest. I don't know if that's simply because it's the largest key, but every time you hit space (which is incredibly often), the sound just sticks out. Again, this is nothing compared to the crazy loud mechanical keyboards, but I wouldn't call it ""whisper quiet.""

Now, before you cut me off talking about the included silicone key cover - NO, that is not how you make a keyboard quiet. Typing with it on is ridiculous and weird. As a dust protector, I say it's a nice touch to include it but it's dumb to type with it on. It feel weird and sticky.

Finally, back to the mouse. I mentioned above that the clicking is disconcertingly silent. This is awesome, and it's one of the reasons I decided to give the set a go. My office is completely open to the rest of the house, so I liked the idea of silencing myself a little more for late evening work sessions. HOWEVER, that scroll wheel. Yeesh. It's really weird to be using a mouse that you can hardly hear, then suddenly SCRAPE SCRAPE SCRAPE whenever you scroll. It's an odd, hollow, plasticky scrape that doesn't fit into the smoothness of the rest of the mouse. If the manufacturer could find a way to smooth this out, you'd have one of the best-functioning quiet mice on the market!

TL;DR
Pros:
Solid, quiet-ish keyboard
Laptop-like typing experience
Really responsive
Rechargable keyboard (not mouse, though)
Super silent mouse clicking
Solid connection - no lag whatsoever in mouse or keyboard
Extended media/function keys

Cons:
Clacky spacebar
Neither keyboard nor mouse are fully ""whisper silent""
Cheap-sounding, loud-ish mouse scroll wheel",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$40.00 ,,,Lee Kindle,"BEST keyboard you can buy, both for key feel and ergonomic/proper design!","Reviewed in the United States on November 17, 2017","Long review ahead: short version, just buy it and try it. You won't be returning it, trust me!

This is not only an absolutely fantastic SPLIT style keyboard, but also one of the best in terms of key/tactile feel I've ever owned. I've tried all the usual mechanical keyboards, blue & brown switches (way overrated IMO) along with the legendary buckling spring switches. Yes, this is a rubber dome keyboard, BUT, it feels to me anyhow like a quiet and lighter touch buckling spring keyboard (think IBM Model M) without all the racket a buckling spring or cherry blue switch (or even brown) keyboard can make. It has a nice tactile snap to the keys and sounds similar to a Topre keyboard (youtube it) and has a nice muffled ""thock"" type sound, no clacky-ness at all. Even the larger stabilized keys are mostly quiet, and the one or two that aren't can be made quiet by adding a little white grease lube (search amzn for elite keyboards grease) to the metal stabilizer underneath the key after carefully removing it with a keycap puller or very carefully prying off.

This keyboard has a little shorter key travel distance than a full key height keyboard; about 80%, but is just enough shorter that it is actually a better travel distance IMO and allows for a very quick and light touch to the keys, but still gives that satisfying ""press"" you get on a full travel keyboard. As noted above, the key feel is light, but not too light and has a nice tactile snap (think buckling spring) that you will not get with the overrated mx brown style switch.

The split of the board is perfect and puts your hands, arms and shoulders in a very natural position for typing, and also has a full size wrist rest to place the palms of your hands when not actively typing.

One thing some folks may complain about is the arrow/home key cluster; do not let that deter you from trying this board. I actually prefer this layout as it allows your trackball (or mouse) to come in closer to your hands than if they used the standard ibm layout. Once you get used to the more condensed layout of the arrow keys and home/end/delete cluster, you'll realize it is very very logically laid out and actually makes more sense. So IMO I believe it's truly a better layout than the older IBM format. Your mileage may vary.

I've been using split keyboards since the original MS one came out in the late 90's and this Perixx split keyboard is very similar to the old MS elite version, but much better. The key feel and overall construction along with a split spacebar make THIS keyboard the best split keyboard you can buy, not to mention it's an incredible value also. I pair this board with a Logitech M570 trackball and it's a match made in heaven. My hands and wrists never experience pain and typing on this board is so comfortable and the muted/quiet, light snappy tactile feedback is incredible. I have never enjoyed a keyboard more than this one. It hits ALL the checkboxes. I'd happily pay 2-3 times what they charge for it also. And have for other boards that couldn't hold a candle to this one.

Note: I was NOT paid or compensated in any way to write this review, and I normally don't write reviews unless I really like something. I LOVE this keyboard :-) and you will too. If you are new to split keyboards, use this one solely for a week and you will not go back to a non-split board ever again, and when/if you have to use a ""normal"" keyboard you'll wonder how you ever did.

",$40.00 ,,,Elak Swindell,Decent Keyboard With Some Issues,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2018","
  Compared to Microsoft's Ergonomic keyboard, this is a decent replacement.  There are minor issues that are somewhat annoying though.  First off, unlike Microsoft's board, this one angles down and doesn't have little lift legs on the front to bring it up.  There are two legs in the back, but what is the point in that?  They should be on the front.  So, if you have the board on a pull-out desk shelf at waist height, the wrist supports are totally useless if you use those rear legs.  Even if you place it on the desk, they are still pointless since the you have to angle the wrists just to use them.  Sure, you can retract them and have partial use of the support bar, but the wrists are still angled instead of being straight, which is the whole point of the bar in the first place.  Bad design idea.  The layout for the Home, End, Delete, Page Up/Down and Insert keys is not very friendly to that of the more known keyboard layout since they are vertical instead of horizontal.  Normally I know exactly where they are and don't have to look.  With this board, I do every time until I get used to.  Lastly, the two spacebars are a bit stiff, at least on mine.  The left one likes to act as if it needs a bit more pressure than normal to go down at times.  They work fine, but could be more smooth in their movement.  Other than those issues, I like the board, but would really like to raise the front up so the wrist support area was useful.

It has problems and I may have to return it. Following are the pros and the cons so far:

Pros:
- It is the right size in terms of foot-print on the desk and individual key dimensions, with a standard key layout.
- The keys feel ""good"" and it is very pleasant to type on them. The travel depth is like 3-4 mm which is perfect for me.
- The key illumination is adequate, although not great! Essentially it's based on transparent key caps which have been painted over in black with the letter symbols left ""unpainted"". Had they used bolder characters the illumination would have been stronger.
- Competitively priced.

Cons:
- The on/off switch for the keyboard illumination doesn't work. The scroll Lock key which is the same key doesn't work either. The status LED for the key doesn't work either. This was tested on several computers.
- The keyboard prevents the computer from going to sleep, suspend or hibernate mode. With any one of these modes activated the computer starts the appropriate cycle, but ""wakes-up"" because of ""keyboard action"" according to the computer logs. This was also tested on several different computer types/models.
- The sides of the key caps which are left unpainted (transparent) to let light come out look ""dirty"" as if someone applied spray paint on them - all of them. That gives the product an unprofessional look.
- The vendor Perixx claims that this keyboard was designed in Germany. It may be so, but the cons that I listed above make it look like a cheap unbranded clone product.

Don't know why anyone would want to turn the back lights off. Some reviewers were saying the off and on switch (scroll lock) didn't work. Mine works just fine. But I don't need it. Leave it lit all the time.  If I could make an improvement I would like an adjustment to make the back lighting brighter or dimmer according to the user's druthers.

",$19.99 ,Perixx,104,William R. Russell,"Good layout, excellent backlight, but very noisy","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2020","I like the layout & backlighting on this keyboard well enough. I wish it had volume & multimedia controls, but I can live without them. The flat key tops make it a little difficult to keep fingers on target, but that's not the major problem.

What I can't live with is the noise. The keys clack loudly, both on the downstroke and the return stroke. There is some kind of plastic-on-plastic squeaking that happens on most of the keys, and that's after a few weeks of regular use. Pressing the spacebar gently sounds like somebody knocking on a door and a bird chirping at the same time.

  Wow am I impressed with both keyboard and mouse.  My 6 month old HP Envy 27"" all-in-one went wacko all of a sudden.  I couldn't do anything.  So I logged off and went to my Surface laptop and did some research.  Since this was already the 2nd time I had an issue with the keyboard, along with others as well...I decided to search for a new set.  My space is limited so I knew I did not want an extra long or deep keyboard.  After reading the reviews, I chose this set up.  The keys are very easy to use.  Nice depth to them, and spacing is just fine.  Mouse is very quiet, and moves very well.  It is small and more flat.  I have a small hand and it is perfect for me.Set up was a breeze.  I know some mentioned issues with set up.  I had none.  First off I unplugged my PC.  Took batteries out of old set, and turned them both off.  Moved the old set to another room.  Read the instructions.... I put NEW batteries in both keyboard and mouse, and turned them both on.  I put the dongle in the port on the PC.  I had everything set to go, before I turned on the power to the PC.  The I powered on the PC.  Num lock was lit up on keyboard.  I tried the caps lock, and it lit up as well.  I was able to log in with no issues.  When I went to the web... it didn't display anything at first.  Then a pop up window said the blue tooth was setting up the new devises.  Then with a matter of seconds another window appeared and said everything was set up and ready to go.  All is awesome!!

I purchased this keyboard because everybody on discord was getting tired of the ""click-clacking"" of my mechanical keyboard. The keyboard itself is very quiet but it still gives me a tactile experience that is slightly better than my brown switch mechanical keyboard. The key setup takes some getting used to, like the backspace and the delete button take up the space of a normal backspace button. So I would be hitting delete when I needed the backspace. The Numpad set up his novel. It has a backspace button where the minus would usually go. The - and + replace the + on a normal Numpad. I haven't had to use the Numpad that much, but I'll update this review if it does detract from the experience.

The mouse is incredibly quite. I enjoy that you can change the DPI settings on the mouse, but I do miss the side buttons that were on my old mouse.

I erroneously thought that since I had destroyed the original box, I could not return the defective keyboard.  They explained that they back their products with a 24 month warranty and that it did not matter.  I was send a replacement and the second one has performed flawlessly as of now.  I changed my review to reflect this.  Kudos to Aukey for backing up their product with some top notch customer service.***

  The keyboard serves a dual purpose.  In addition to being a proper tool for learning typing (for the kids), it allows me to tell when they're using the computer from anywhere in the house.  It hasn't driven me crazy yet, so that's a definite plus.For the adults, this is a great mechanical keyboard, using blue switches.  The color changes get on my nerves, so I just turned illumination off.  The handbook contains all the standard key shortcuts, and I plan to keep mine around, as some of them are not entirely obvious from the pictures on the keyboard.Overall, a solid 5 stars.  Good build quality, looks to be fairly indestructible with normal usage.  Keys feel good on my fingers, due to just the right amount of rounding.  There are no sharp spots to cut myself, as was the case with another similar keyboard I purchased before.

Miller,High quality and feature rich for only $26!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2017","So far this have been an exceptional purchase and I have been pleasantly surprised. This feels like a heavy mechanical keyboard but without the excessive clicking noise or the need to remove and reinstall individual keys then add dozens of individual rubber bumpers to quiet the clicking sound! The LED back-lighting is superb and keeps me from having to use additional lights at night. The competitor's version of this keyboard (Razor Chroma) starts at $90 and goes up from there. I would have easily paid $50 and not thought twice if I had a chance to try it out in a store first. For gaming its phenomenal! I will buy additional keyboards for my children's PCs.

CONS for a thorough review (though I'm being finicky):
1. It's heavy so if you are looking for a ""mobile"" keyboard DON'T buy this unless you also want a workout!
2. Some colors (Red, Dark Blue, Purple) my older eyes have trouble seeing the letters and symbols of certain keys so I choose white, green, yellow, or light blue. Youngsters or those with near-sighted corrected lenses may not experience an issue
3. The keys are tall (as is a true mechanical KB) so if you are used to a ""Chiclet-type"" laptop KB this may take some practice as your fingers have to move further
4. The LED ""alert"" lights for Num-lock, Caps-lock, etc. are not color changeable and stay at a light blue color.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

I do wish the TAB and BACKSPACE keys were oversized (as I'm used to on most keyboards) but I could see that from the product pictures so no fair griping.  Really is not a problem.The feel and usability of the mouse is also very good.  It's quiet and glides nicely on many surfaces.  There are gripes about the battery compartment coming open and I can understand those.  It's held closed with a magnet against a screw.  If you have trouble with your's coming apart try backing the screw out a bit to make for a more secure catch.  Or do like I did and use a small piece of white electrical tape to secure the battery door.  In all honesty most of my mice have tape on their battery doors because I drop the darn things a lot.

Keyboard advertises 100 hours of typing on one charge. Obviously I haven’t gotten that far yet, but so far, so good.

If you want a tablet keyboard for doing serious typing, this is a great choice. It doesn’t come with a case or hard cover, and as Bluetooth keyboards go it is on the large side. For that reason it might not be the best choice if portability is your biggest concern.

Oh, and obviously the ability to connect to 2 devices at once is pretty great!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I absolutely LOVE this keyboard! It's so cute and fits perfectly with what I wanted. It types well and makes little noise but hitting the keys feels nice. I'm using it with my 9.7in iPad and it fits in the indent really well I think it's perfect for typing on your lap or even on a desk. Once paired it will connect immediately to the iPad everytime you turn it on and the keys commands work to lock and unlock the ipad with only the keyboard. I'm starting to think about getting a mouse now just to complete the functionality of my set up!The only think I think I need is some extra grippers for lap writing but I already have an idea of where to get them and that's just personal preference. The weight of the keyboard is about the same as the ipad so it doesnt move that much but my legs are skinny so I fit right between the grippers lol other than the lack of some backlight for the keys this is the Perfect keyboard!!

",$34.99 ,Jelly Comb,,Drew Leo,Best Value for Bluetooth Tablet Keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2019"," Thoroughly impressed. For people who work and type a lot on tablet, this is an essential tool. Frankly, if I had this when I was a student, this would more than suffice. Here are some key features that I really enjoy:

• Design/Keyboard: It's slim and very easy to fit in a small bag with a tablet. The keyboard, in my opinion, feels MUCH MUCH better than those soft smart keyboards sold at much higher price point. It somewhat gives a mechanical keyboard feel and has some feedback. I personally do not like those soft keyboard that gives little feedback when you type so this is definitely a plus.

• Weight: It's light but it has some weight to it. However, it's not just dense for no reason. The weight is added so that when you lean your tablet on it it doesn't fall backwards. Nothing is more annoying than an unstable tablet stand that keeps collapsing or falling over when you are working on a desk. This keyboards does NOT have this issue what so ever. I was rather concerned initially because when you place the table vertically, it stands rather tall and it leans backward quite far. However, because of the weight, this thing is completely firm even with your tablet standing vertically. In fact, watch my review video, you can see that even when I TRY to push it backwards, it won't fall. It's a very thoughtful design and the weight isn't noticeable in your bag.

• Convenient function keys: I LOVE the copy/paste button. Frankly, I wonder why these two buttons aren't a standard on ALL computer keyboards... One strange thing that I noticed is that it doesn't work on Apple's ""Notes"" app but it works on Safari. The other functions like brightness/volume adjustment are also very convenient. Another cool feature is that it supports two devices at once so no need to go through the whole, disconnect, forget device, connect annoyance.

• Battery Life: It lasts a very long while. I was able to use it on and off throughout the day without any issue.

Conclusion: A must have for anyone who work and type on tablet on the regular basis.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo - Keyboard and Mouse Included, 2.4GHz Dropout-Free Connection, Long Battery Life (Frustration-Free Packaging)






",$24.99 ,,,Amazon Customer,Updated but NOT Better,"Reviewed in the United States on January 29, 2019","
  Logitech in their infinite wisdom has dropped the unifying dongle from this product. Instead you get a single dongle that only works for this keyboard and mouse. Even worse, they have replaced the Set-Point software with something new called ""Options"". This download is 3 times the size of the old Set-Point software, and the first thing it does is ask you to create an account and to share your history! No Thank You!  Of course the ""Options"" software only controls the mouse, so if you want to map the keyboard, you still need to install the Set-Point package!  I uninstalled the ""Options"" package since this mouse is a very basic mouse and can be controlled with Microsoft generic options. The only function that you lose is the battery monitor.While I have always been a fan of Logitech products, this change from the unifying dongle and this keyboard in particular are changing my opinion. The keyboard has a pretty solid feel to it, but it constantly drops keystrokes. Since that is the primary function of a keyboard, I cannot recommend it. Also, the mouse that comes with this package feels really cheap (probably because it is cheap).  Those 2 problems combined make this package not a bargain. I am very disappointed that Logitech is dropping the unifying dongle and software. That change alone is enough to make me look elsewhere for keyboard and mouse replacements. Overall, not recommended!

  User must install Logitech's control center package (download from Logitech).  But Mac OS Catalina has many security barriers and Logitech's code does not play nicely with those.  It wants access to all keystroke input, to the screen, and to the file system(!).  I tried to grant those but Logitech's documentation was out of data and I could find no way to grant the necessary screen/file permissions.  Also, installation requires several reboots of the Mac.Also, Logitech control center said ""no Logitech devices found"" despite fact that the mouse was working and the keyboard was sort of working (but things like caps lock, function keys, and other necessities did not work.)Mac OS Catalina works fine with wired USB mice and keyboards without need of any additional software.

",$24.99 ,,,Katy,Eh,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2020","**UPDATE** A couple of weeks later, I have already returned this product and knocked a star off of my review. Even with the USB receiver within sight of the mouse & keyboard, there was so much lag that I just couldn't work with it. I replaced it with a wired mouse and keyboard.

**ORIGINAL REVIEW** This combo was working fantastically when I set it up, right up until today when I got a couple of hours into work and the keyboard basically stopped working. I turned both mouse and keyboard off, replaced the batteries, and disconnected then reconnected the USB receiver. Still having the same problem. The mouse works wonderfully but the keyboard is non-responsive.

I started searching Amazon for another product, wanting to stick with Logitech but thinking maybe I should just get something at a higher price point. In a review of a similar Logitech product, someone explained that they had the same issue but corrected it by placing the USB receiver within sight of the keyboard and mouse. So, I tried this and it has seemed to fix the issue. (I have my monitors on my desk with the keyboard & mouse, but everything is run through my laptop which I had stored under the desk. I moved the laptop to the top of my desk.)

It's all working fine now, but I'm still only giving three stars because this is not ideal. I'll continue to use this for now, but will be replacing it in the near future so I can have my desk arranged the way I prefer it to be. Prospective buyers.. be aware that you will likely need your equipment arranged in a way that allows the USB receiver to be within sight of the mouse and keyboard (so if you have a computer tower that's stored under your desk and would be difficult to place elsewhere, you'll probably want to go with something different)",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  The USB Dongle is tucked inside of the battery compartment where it is hard to see and I thought it was missing.  Thankfully the customer care rep from Amazon knew right were the dongle was and when I looked a second time I noticed it.

",,LexonElec,Gaming,Average Shopper,A very decent beginner set.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 15, 2019","
   To start off, the keyboard and mouse are both incredibly quiet.  You can type in a bedroom or office space and have no worries about upsetting other with noise.  This is a membrane keyboard so naturally it will feel a little mushy.  However it's really not a bad experience and there's a decent amount of keytravel to give the keyboard some depth.  The mouse and keyboard connect to the computer with a single usb which is also pretty cool as they don't need their own separate ones.  The keyboard has an ISO enter key which you don't often find in the US which  I find pretty cool.The mouse, when pressed is near silent.  The scroll wheel feels sturdy while being smooth and manages to also give you that ticking feedback which is also a plus in my book.  The chrome highlights on the side do seem pretty cheesy and are going to be prone to fingerprints.  However, the rest of the mouse has a nice flat black finish to it that is much more appealing than other mice with fully reflective surfaces.  The keyboard has a metal top plate and a slot to hold your phone.  Definitely a plus.  A downside is that the backlight is ""Rainbow"" not RGB so you won't see any crazy color movement or patterns but it still manages to look nice.Overall a very reasonable starter set and definitely worth a buy.

",,LexonElec,Gaming,LBD,Great Keyboard - LOUSY instructions,"Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2020","
  I wore the letters off of my last keyboard, so I decided to invest in a gaming keyboard.  I'm under the assumption that they're made to really last (let's hope!).  And let's face it, these beasts are GORGEOUS.  But if you're getting the impression that I'm not a gamer, you'd be right.  I'm a middle-aged housewife with a thing for backlit neon rainbows, so I thought... why not?  Why should the 20-something guys have all the fun?The Good:Pretty.  Oh so... so very... So very very very pretty!  The photo doesn't do it justice, but that's the best my camera could do with the shifting colors.The feel of the keyboard is surprisingly responsive.  I expected the keys to be thuddy rather than springy.  They are, sort of, but instead of being a bother I actually find that I like the old fashioned ""solid"" feel of it.  This set does not feel like a flimsy piece of plastic that's designed to break in 3 months.Speed:  I type between 80-100 WPM, depending on how cold my office is.  I was worried that a keyboard designed for video games wouldn't be able to keep up with me, but it turns out that speed is no issue with this beast.NeutralIt's heavy.  To get that nice ""solid feel"" they made the keyboard of metal rather than plastic.  The weight is listed, but I didn't pay any attention to it until it arrived.  It's not so much that it breaks my wrist or strains my keyboard shelf, but it's certainly hefty enough that it might be featured in one of my upcoming novels (Death by Rainbow, anyone?)  I'm assuming it's this heavy to keep it anchored during rapidfire game play.The bad:NOISY!  In fact, the space key is driving me nuts.  Every time I hit it, it lets off a sort of random clunk/squeak that's really obnoxious.  Otherwise the keys give off a noise you'd expect from a mechanical keyboard.  It's not suitable if you're using this in a shared bedroom or any other location where silence is golden.  In fact, you might want to invest in noise-cancelling headphones.The instructions are instructions in name only.  I'm guessing they are contractually obligated to provide them, but that contract doesn't specify that they need to make sense.  It took me quite a while to figure out how to charge the keyboard - reading the instructions just made it take longer.  I thought I knew what they wanted, but when I checked with the information provided it seemed to indicate something else!  It was only by ignoring the booklet completely that I was able to get it plugged in correctly.When I finally located the receiver I thought it was really clever.  They buried it in the base of the mouse so it won't get lost.  But not knowing that in advance and having gibberish for instructions, I spent quite a while looking for it under the assumption that I somehow dropped it during unboxing.If you're using this primarily for typing the ""enter"" key will take some getting used to.  The shape is inverted from what I'm used to.  Typically ""enter"" is double-wide on the middle row.  Sometimes the key will extend up to the top row in a backwards ""L"" shape.  On this keyboard it's just the opposite - the ""L"" shape is inverted so that the narrow part is level with the middle row (location of the ""home"" keys"").  Instead of the double-wide ""enter"" there's an extra ""slash"" key (or ""backslash"", if you prefer).  All morning I've been hitting \\\ every time I want to hit ""enter"" instead.  I'm already getting used to it, but it's still a bit unexpected.My gripes with this keyboard, overall, are pretty petty.  If I can get the ""clunk / squeak"" spacebar under control the rest of it really isn't worth mentioning.  Overall it's a dazzling addition to my office and a pleasant surprise for the money.  Just... don't read the instructions.  Just... don't.So I came here, hoping to find some answers.  Should you decide to purchase this combo bookmark THIS listing.  The instructions here are detailed and make sense, and this is the only place I found them.

It's got a great weight to it, the feel of the mechanical keys is great and its just beautiful. The mouse is really nice as well. I like the kit a lot.

However, the 'programmable' keyboard lights and mouse are not really programmable. The keyboard is always going to be rainbow colored, and the mouse is always going to rotate through different colors. You can't change that.

The other issue I have is that the keys are only visible when the backlight is on. So when the keyboard shuts off, you have to hit a key to get it to light back up.

Neither of these issues are terrible, but having the ability to actually program the keyboard or see the keys without the backlight would make this keyboard even better.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  I was looking for a gaming keyboard for my little son (he loves his existing RGB keyboard), because his current keyboard is a little too professional for his age (he’s only 5 and his keyboard is >$100).  He gets excited some times and will bang on the keys or accidentally spill his drink.  I decided that it’s time to get him an inexpensive “colorful” gaming keyboard that is durable and can stand accidental spills.  It seems this keyboard and mouse combo is perfect for the requirements.After unboxing, I was stunned at how this keyboard was built.  It is built like a tank.  The case is made of thick aluminum.  The keyboard keys are made of hard plastic.  I’m sure this keyboard can withstand little kids’ excitement.  The mouse is not bad either, it is elegantly built with nice reflective finish.  Out of the box, I have to charge both mouse and keyboard for an hour before testing.  I played COD multiplayer, and even though these are wireless, there is no noticeable lag.  But I do have a lot of wireless devices at home that may cause interference, so I have to had the USB dongle close to both mouse and keyboard, and it worked fine.So, how does the keyboard feel?  This keyboard is pseudo mechanical (not real mechanical), but it feels somewhere right between the Cherry MX Brown and MX Red switches.  It has a good tactile feedback, and the clicky sound is very minimal.  I wouldn’t mind using this keyboard for competitive gaming, it feels very responsive.Overall, this keyboard looks and feels heavy duty.  The lights have not much customization in it, but they look great as it is.  It has a high capacity battery, and I’m sure this will last a long time in between charges.  If you’re looking for a good gaming KB/mouse combo, you should definitely consider trying this.

  I bought this keyboard and mouse set (part number RMK709) back in June of 2018.  I wanted something compact for traveling, but still big enough for my big dumb gorilla monkey fingers to be able to type on it acceptably.  I'm not going to lie, it took some getting used to, but now that I am, I could not have been more pleased with the purchase.And the size is deceptive.  The keyboard is the same size as the one on my HP 17"" powerhouse laptop.  Although my laptop has the 10-key off to the right and this keyboard doesn't, I can prop the little feet on the edge of my laptop (which helps the ergonomics and allows me to sit far enough away from my laptop to see, and reach right past it comfortably when 10-key input is needed.  The only thing I could want for on the keyboard is the DEL, END, HOME, PRTSCR, etc buttons to have their own row.  Mushing a function key gets old.It also came with a little mouse, but once again, I have to say the little mouse doesn't FEEL anything shy of what you would expect in a mouse I would pay >$80.  It isn't heavy, but it feels like it is made of substance and not hollow cheap plastic.  Regardless of its composition, it is weighted properly IMO, the clicks are tangibly resonant; meaning no mistaking if you did or did not click and thereby get your ""click's worth.""If it is of any consequence, using the mouse and keyboard today - a year and a half after purchase - made me want to go back and make sure I leave this review of how pleased I am with the product.  This kit made it through more TSA checkpoints and baggage scrutiny at airports so many times it is eligible for frequent flier miles! :D  It is durable (like I said, I am little more than a gorilla in a monkey suit, trying to be a hooman).  I have smashed it into my luggage, watched it get beat up with my luggage when they load/unload the planes, and never once has this given me any trouble.One other note, it will connect to anything!  I have connected it to my Chromecast, my Amazon Fire Stick, even my cell phone.  I really love this thing.Finally, in saying all this, I still have to mention I still have the original batteries in the keyboard AND mouse!  I'm sure your results may vary but mine have been far better than expected, for far longer than expected.  I bought it to travel once.  I have traveled all over North America since (more than 400,000 miles worth of flights).  Not a single issue.  Not one.  I highly recommend!

Key size, height, action and spacing is right on par with most modern laptops. Solid feel and quality build. The mouse is a decent size and capable. The best feature is the power/sleep and volume/mute keys on the top edge of the keyboard. Why doesn't everyone put a power key on every PC keyboard? Works flawlessly with my stick PC.

  I had a macally mouse for about 4-5 years and then it broke. I was trying to figure out if it was the mouse or the plastic macally keyboard I had it connected to .

I really missed the feel of those keys compared to my macally plastic one. what a difference ! but I hated wasting so many batteries and having to go bluetooth.

  I got this keyboard to leave at the office so I wouldn't have to take my apple keyboard along with my macbook pro when I work from the office (I mostly work from home). Upon opening the box I was impressed by the look at first. It looked well built and very similar to the apple keyboard. Sadly thats where the similarities end. They keys feel mushy and make a quiet, yet annoying, rattling sound as you type. Another big downside to the keyboard is that theres a ton of flex in it. It has an aluminum (maybe) looking top like the apple keyboard is, but I think its actually just a very thin layer placed over very thin plastic because lightly pressing anywhere on the top of the keyboard causes it to flex a good deal. For a $50 keyboard the quality is NOT there, so I am probably going to be sending it back and getting something else.

  I bought this to replace my Mac bluetooth keyboard due to intermittent bluetooth issues with my Mac.  It works perfectly and has a nice look and feel.  My only reservation (for right-handed mousers) is that the (very useful) numeric keypad and special function keys make the keyboard about 6"" wider than the Apple Magic Keyboard.  This causes your mouse to be about 6"" further away from your customary position if you want to center the QWERTY portion of the keyboard on your computer.  The alternative is to shift the keyboard off center from the computer, which is not the end of the world once you get used to it.

",,Macally,Standalone,Robert,"Yes, there are issues, but it's pretty good","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020","Out of all the Mac clone keyboards out there, I chose this one because its key layout most closely resembles the traditional Mac full-size keyboard. The left control, option and command keys are more or less the right size and they are in the right place, uninterrupted by a pesky ""fn"" key. The forward delete key is in the right spot, too, which was important for me.

Overall, I have been pleased with it. The ""touch"" is quite light and responsive and the keyboard looks pretty good. Most of the Mac shortcut keys are there: monitor brightness, volume, eject, etc. One shortcut key that is missing that I use all the time is the Mission Control key (F3 on a standard Mac keyboard.) You can, however, set up your own shortcut for Mission Control in System Preferences, if you want.

Some cons: it is noticeably flimsier than a Mac wired keyboard. You can notice the entire keyboard flexing in the middle as you type. This doesn't bother me much or impede my typing, but I can see that it might drive some people nuts. As many others have noted, there does seem to be a major flaw with the caps lock LED light. The key itself works fine, but after a day or two, the white LED caps lock indicator at the upper right stopped working, so if you accidentally hit the caps lock key, you won't know it UNTIL EVERYTHING YOU TYPE IS IN ALL CAPS. I guess if you are prone to this, you might want to reconsider buying this keyboard. So far for me it hasn't been an issue.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  This keyboard replaced my ""deceased due to extreme old age"" Apple USB wired keyboard that was dropped by Apple in favor of a wireless, battery-operated product.  The Macally keyboard is almost an exact copy of my old Apple keyboard, with the only meaningful differences being: the function keys' shortcut icons are slightly different and a file save function key is added on bottom row,  function keys F16, F17, F18 and F19 at the upper left are replaced with a caps locked indicator (moved from the key) and a function keys locked indicator.  The keystroke feel very similar, just a bit more crisp and positive, and feels a little better to me.  The most significant functional difference is the lack of USB jacks, which may bother folks who were using the ones on their old keyboard, usually for a wired mouse.  I never used the USB jacks in my old keyboard so that's not an issue for me.  The box included a link to register the product and get an extra year of warranty - 2 years total.  I like this keyboard a lot and hope it holds up for a few years beyond that warranty.

It is fully mechanical as promised with multiple different RGB backlight modes, which is a great plus. On top of this I only just learned that the keyboard had 5 different customizable profiles, which is especially great for a keyboard that only costs about 40 USD.

It is NOT a tenkeyless keyboard which might be a downer for some people, but for a price tag of 40 dollars this is BEYOND a steal.

Edit: Well uhh the mouse broke after 2 weeks but it's not like I cared for it so yeah.

",,Keychron,Multimedia,-,Well made entry-level mechanical,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020","There is a lot to like about this keyboard. The build quality is very good. I picked the Gateron Brown switches and I’m quite happy with them. There is very little flex or deck bounce — this is a well designed product especially for the price. The sound when typing is pleasant.

I’ve used it with Mac, iPad, Raspberry Pi, and a single-board Linux/Win10 computer. Bluetooth worked fine on all of them.

The key feel is fine, but I may try out some o-ring (switch dampeners) to soften the impact a bit. I tend to bottom out the switches when typing fast.

My wishes/complaints:

The Bluetooth sleep timer is short. Even just 10 more minutes would make a big difference and probably wouldn’t impact batter life that much. The sleep timer can be turned off, but a longer timer would be nicer.

The layout is fine, but as a Programmer/Linux user, having to hit Fn2+Esc to get the “~” is awkward. I’ll probably remap some of the keys. There is no software with this board, you need to use whatever your OS can use for mapping layers.

I have been using it for about a week and have no complaints. For $39 I honestly don’t think you can get a better deal anywhere. This keyboard has a solid build to it, customization, and mechanical switches. The modes as follows Solid color, linear row pulse , Single key highlight, multi key blotch highlight, slow pulse (color shift), linear row build up. Keyboard also has height adjustment which some keyboards ( Anne Pro 2 $100) keyboard don’t even offer. This keyboard also also a verity of switches, so you can choose which ever switch fits your needs. Personally I love blue switches for their responsiveness and sound. Plug-And-Play so no additional software needed to set this keyboard up. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone that wants a new keyboard for gaming or just wants a keyboard that looks amazing plus bluetooth.

Pros-
-Small for factor (allows for much more free space)
-Fully customizable

- Height adjustment

",,DIERYA,Gaming,Scott Novis,"Great Value, Great Feel, Great portability, Here's the color modes","Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019","**Key Take Away**: This is the most portable mechanical clicky keyboard I have found at half the price I paid for larger, name-brand keyboards (that had less than half the features).

# My Review
This winter I went crazy looking for the ""perfect"" keyboard to write a book. For a variety of reasons, I had to reduce my office to a backpack, meaning everything went onto my MacBook Pro, and my iPad Pro as my second screen. The butterfly keyboard on the mac is tragically bad, but the new scissor keys won't be out until mid-2020. I tried making the switch to a windows laptop - Love the Lenovo X1 Carbon, but as I am heavily invested in the Apple eco-system, it was just too painful. So my MacBook stays. As a result, I proceeded to try, seven keyboards. That's right. 7. I am very picky about my key feel. I prefer clicky keys - Red Switches are smooth but don't provide that satisfying click. Brown switches, while quiet, and have a tactile bump, are too subtle for my taste. I like the blue switches. I want to HEAR and FEEL the click.

While I found keyboards I love, most are too big and heavy to take on the road. Then I found the DIERYA. Why this was the LAST keyboard I tried, I don't know. But, I have to give Dierya credit. This keyboard nailed all my requirements. They have a blue switch (clicky) version which I LOVE. The keyboard supports Bluetooth to THREE devices - which means I can work on my MacBook Pro, my iPad Pro, or my iPhone. That is awesome. It has a USB-C connector, which I thought would let me connect USB-C to USB-C with my Mac! But as of yet, the keyboard has only worked with the cable it came with :-( and I'm not sure why.

My cons for the keyboard are mostly minor. The Shift and /? are not where I expect them, but with such a compact layout, I will make the effort to adjust. I just have to pay attention and make sure I don't press 'up' when I mean to shift.

Finally, I wanted to share the lighting pattern on the December 2019 version of the keyboard:

## Lighting Info
The keyboard has 8 programmed RGB light modes, and you can switch the backlight (Static) color!

You change modes with FN+/

## Here are the preprogrammed RGB modes:

1. Solid color - no key response. When you type a key it stays in that color.

2. Chaser - fills in keyboard with colors racing/chasing across the keyboard.

3. Wave - a wave of rainbow colors wash across the board. The keys do not respond to your keypress.

4. Ripple - keys go to your solid color, then when you press a key, a rainbow effect spreads out from the center. **Note**: You can slow down the ripple using FN+← to slow it down and FN+→ to speed it up.

5. Row ripple - this pattern keeps the keys in the default color, but when you type the row ripples.

6. Single Key Flash - (Footprints?) This mode the keys you type flash RGB, but do not affect the keys around them. (I kind of like this mode because it gives feedback when you type. **This is my favorite mode**

7. Splash - This mode does a rainbow ripple to only the adjacent keys you have typed. _this is my second favorite mode_

8. Breathing - in this mode the keys do not respond (visually) to your typing, but the whole keyboard breaths the RGB color cycle.

You can change the backlight (static) color with FN+Enter

- Red
- Blue
- Green
- Purple
- Yellow
- Turquoise
- White
- Black. Off

I am super impressed with this keyboard, and I highly recommend it. I don't have any experience with its durability as I just unboxed it, but I am so impressed that I literally sat down to write this review with my new keyboard.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

DIERYA DK63 Wireless 60% Mechanical Gaming Keyboard True RGB Backlit Bluetooth 4.0 Wired LED Computer Keyboard for Multi-Device iPhone Android Mobile PC Laptop - Brown Switch






",,DIERYA,Gaming,Justin Oros,AMAZING PRODUCT FOR THE $$$,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2019","This is an amazing little mechanical keyboard for the money!

I have several other high-end/cost mechanical keyboards and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality, functionality, and feel of this little mech.

PROS:
Affordable pricing
A true-mechanical keyboard (their brown switches actually feel like brown switches and don't make clicky sounds like red switches do)
RGB Keys (with several presets you can toggle through with the FN key, even changing the speed of the animations)
USB-C connection (internal rechargable battery that charges from this connection)
Braided USB to USB-C cable
Wireless keyboard (Blueooth- capable of pairing with more than 1 device, and toggling between devices with FN+keypress)
2 Spare Keycaps (with custom logos, because the ""Windows"" key has to go! I use Linux)
Key-cap Removal Tool Included
Clear and simple instructions
Attractive packaging
Light-weight (it's not light weight but it is light-weight in comparison to most other mechanical keyboards on the market)

CONS (if I must list some):
ISO Key Layout (I am used to ANSI in the USA but ISO is not that different so I can key-hunt a little bit until I get used to it)
Small Right-SHIFT key (I find myself hitting the UP arrow key every time when I am trying to hit RIGHT SHIFT)
Windows/Super Key (I was looking forward to replacing the ""Windows Key"" with the little Crown logo key but after doing so I noticed that the crown key actually sits a little higher than the other keys.. however, it functions well)
The Brand Name = ""DIERYA"" (Sound it out.. haha)

In summary, for the money, I don't believe you can find a better little mechanical keyboard! If you're looking for a 61-key mechanical RGB keyboard you can't go wrong with this one!",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  Just to disclose, this product is made from what feels to be cheap plastic.  When I first unboxed it, I was rather unimpressed.  I've been using it for about 24 hours and my opinion has changed completely.  Sure, it's made of plastic and feels really lite in the hand, but once you're used to this layout, it makes typing a breeze.  The keys are responsive and the keyboard/mouse feel really nice to use.

  Great compacted keyboard and mouse Combo.  This is not bluetooth.  Your PC sees it as a USB device.  You can even boot to the EUFI without a wired keyboard/mouse.  I'm using it with a PC running Linux.  There was no setup for me.  I plugged in the USB adapter, turned on the keyboard and mouse, and started using them.  Easy, simple, brilliant.Not sure about the battery life, but it's done very well in the month since I got it.I can type from 15 feet away without issue.  Great range and connectivity.  My blue tooth keyboard and mouse would stop working for no apparent reason and then reconnect. Even when I was close to the PC.  That was very annoying.  So far this pair has never lost connectivity.The keyboard is very responsive.  The mouse works great and it's very quiet.  If you put the included cover on the keyboard, it's fairly quiet too.  The cover is a little odd looking (it's like a prophylactic for a keyboard), but I like that it quiets the keyboard and the finger tip feel, although, it did take a little getting used to.  You can even wash off the cover in the sink.  No more crumbs in the keyboard.I would highly recommend this keyboard and mouse.

",$31.99 ,,,G. Reagon,Great keyboard and mouse combo.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2020","
  Im giving this item an overall score of 4 stars.  The reason for the one star reduction is I think the mouse could benefit from being a little more ergonomic to craddle the palm of ones hand.  The mouse is a bit flat in shape so you have no palm support when using it, and I have average size hands.  Maybe it's just my personal preference.Overall however, it's a very nice keyboard and mouse combo for the price.  The quality is good.  The keys have good travel and relitively quiet.  I love the silicone cover that you get to put over the keyboard to keep crumbs and other gunk from getting between the keys and in the keyboard.  Although I wish the mouse was a bit more ergonomic, it is very responsive and virtually dead silent when you click the buttons.  I'd recommend to others.

",$31.99 ,,,G-Wiz,Compact wireless keyboard & mouse are super!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 7, 2020","I really like the keyboard & mouse. It's compact but not cramped for typing. The key spacing is just right for me. The keys themselves are a little larger & that seems to help me with accuracy, I'm not hitting two keys at once when I'm hurrying. the keyboard is relatively quiet, too, which is nice. I'd say the amount of pressure needed on the keys is light to medium which I like, no neurotic (too sensitive) keyboards for me. I'm using the silicone cover to protect it & that is affecting both the pressure & the quietness, more the quietness than the pressure.

The mouse is nice, too, very lightweight, responsive & very easy to move around.

I haven't used it long enough to comment on the battery life, but I'll update if it's really good or really bad.  The only negative - which I didn't really think about when I bought it, so it's not the fault of the keyboard - is that the on/off switch for the keyboard is on the bottom.

  Bought this for my daughter but decided to use myself.  The color and design is extremely well done and tasteful.  The two tone is very nice to look at.Finish is seemless, the feel of both keyboard and mouse is light and functional, you can tell they really paid attention to details. As a touch typist, I'm very happy with the way the keys feel, quiet and responsive.  The mouse fits my hand perfectly, but more importantly, it can track on fabric and on white surfaces without stuttering.  It is plug and play and the response is instantaneous.I love this keyboard/mouse combo.  Both take AAA batteries.  I use rechargeables and much prefer this layout than the ones with internal batteries.  I've had keyboards die on me in the past because for some reason the batteries go bad or has bad contact...with these you can easily open the battery compartment and replace fix as required.  Both the keyboard and mouse have off switches which is a huge plus.In my opinion, this is one of the finer keyboard/mouse on the market.  Super happy with this buy, I just love the form, feel and functionality.  If you live your life in front of a keyboard, do yourself a favor and try this out...it just works, perfectly, without distraction or problems.My daughter loves the keyboard and mouse as well....but she's not getting it back lol.

  I purchased this wireless keyboard and mouse combo for using with my personal laptop. I personally cannot work with the laptop keyboards for a long time. It has a single USB receiver and its connection to the computer and the detection was very easy and fast.The keyboard and mouse have separate switch keys on the backside. Each needs two AAA batteries (not included in the package). The adjustable DPI switch for changing the mouse sensitivity was very interesting to me and I change it depending on my work. The mouse and keyboard are both very silent and the keyboard is sensitive enough to normal finger touch. The keyboard came with a plastic protective cover that can protect the keys from liquids or debris. Once you cover the keyboard with the protective cover, you can hardly hear any sound from the keyboard during your work.Finally, I like the color very much and the sleek and comfortable design of both the keyboard and mouse are quite amazing to me.

They're easy to change as well.  The mouse, while not the most fantastic gaming mouse, is pretty good actually...I would say on par with or just a bit below my current (brand name) mouse.  As with any product that I order to put away for later use, I immediately make sure that it's functioning correctly so that I have a non-functioning item waiting to surprise me.  I would definitely recommend this keyboard/mouse combo for the casual or occasional gamer, and just for typing in general. Very comfortable, attractive, easy to use, and great price!

  Honestly, I bought this keyboard and mouse set for general typing purpose and not gaming. I don’t know how good it is in satisfying gaming criteria. However, for general typing, it’s very smooth and easy. The keys really goes easy with the fingers. They feel soft and premium. The wireless range is also pretty good. Being a PhD student, i have to type a lot of papers and reports and i can feel the difference. Even for beginners, it’s really easy with clear letters and right sizes. I liked keyboard more than the mouse. I have a big palm. So, I would have wanted it more thick. Nevertheless, its pretty comfortable. The mouse is decent but the keyboard is comparable to premium keyboards like those of microsoft. Hands down it deserves five stars.

  Ergonomically speaking, the mouse has a nice feel to it with textured grip on both sides.  It is a bit smaller than my other mouse so my hand doesn't feel like it's resting on the mouse when I use it if that make any sense.  So it's not as comfortable as my old mouse, but it's not bad either.  I have two laptops that I use simultaneously.  The touchpad on one of the laptop recently stopped working.  I was searching for another mouse to buy when I saw this one.  I like the idea that I can use the same mouse on both laptops so that I don't have to have two mice on my desk at the same time.  synching it to both of my laptop was easy.  Turn on the Bluetooth on the laptop, choose add new device, and that's it.  The mouse came with an instruction but it is as easy as that.  Now, I use one mouse to control both laptops.  The one thing I wish they did was put the button to switch between different laptops on top of the mouse and not on the bottom.  Each time I want to switch to a different laptop, I have to turn it over, push a button to switch.  It's a bit of an inconvenience, but it's tolerable such that I can't justify docking a star because of that.  If Victsing happen to read this and make change the next time around, I will definitely buy it again.

It is loud and squeaky, the keys are stiff and I cannot type double letters at all. The keys are unresponsive and will not allow a keystroke to be double pressed.

If you’re buying for a kids new gaming setup, or a general keyboard with a little bit of lights, this is for you. You get what you pay for.
I didn’t think the reviews about wearing keys were true. i was like “who on earth types that hard and that much.” but after about 2 months of gaming, one of my keys is wearing off. The boards that have all of the keys worn off are obviously heavy typers who type all day everyday for work. If you’re not that person then you will be fine! It took 2 months of gaming and typing every day for ONE key to start to fade for me.
Unfortunately, my backspace key did start to stick. it would stay stuck down and delete everything before i could get it back up. All it took was a click flick, or to click it a little harder and i was fine. But this doesn’t happen with every key. It’s a $20 membrane keyboard. you. get. what. you. pay. for. if you want unbeatable quality, performance, durability, spend more than $20 for a keyboard.
The mouse has worked great. No issues there. Might be big for small hands, or maybe kids hands, but I had no complaints with it.
This is a good budget product. If you only have $20 to spend, buy it. If you type all day for a job, buy a better keyboard.

  Setup and configuration of this keyboard was a breeze! Turn it on, put it in pair-mode, detect from the Windows Bluetooth settings and setup is done! The keys are so whisper quiet! I type a lot for my job and when you're on the phone and the person on the other end can hear you typing can cause quite a distraction. Fortunately, with this keyboard from Seenda, this is a thing of the past! The function keys have also been super convenient so I can control the sound, pause music, skip, etc. without having to move my hands off the keyboard! The LED backlight key options are great and can change with my mood! I like having the green, and the two blue colors! It also has three different brightness options, also! For those really low light environments, you can have the backlight brightness configured exactly to your needs! I love that this is rechargeable! No need to carry batteries! I always have a micro-usb cable with me so charging is super easy and you can still use the keyboard while using, a big plus! The included keyboard cover fits like a glove and is nice at keeping the debris off your keys and in-between. Let's face it, in today's world we are having our lunch while working and those crumbs always make their way onto the keyboard. :-) I will definitely continue to use this keyboard with my laptop, even when I travel, too!

The only one that I'm aware of is the insanely expensive Logitech MX. This keyboard is pretty good. Solid build quality. Decent key-spacing and feel. There are only a couple of very minor nitpicks:
-The front-middle foot pad under the keyboard, while a good thought (to prevent buckling when typing), is hard plastic instead of rubber like the others in the 4 corners. So the keyboard makes a slightly annoying sound when you hit keys in the middle area. I solved it by just sticking a little rubber under it.
-I wish the backlight stayed on when the keyboard is plugged in. Even when plugged in, the backlight turns off after 5 minutes.

Other than that, it's pretty decent. It's taking me a little while to get used to the key travel and feel coming from the Logitech k800 2.4ghz.... which has an amazing feel when typing... but I think it's worth it for the lower profile of this one.

",$38.99 ,,,Von,"Light and customizable, but with a two drawbacks + Not compatible with Linux.","Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2020","
  Okay keyboard. Pretty light and silent. No latency between keyboard input and the actual computer. The wide variety of colors and 3-level brightness setting for the backlit is a nice feature. Overall, it's a pretty decent keyboard to have. However, the reason for not giving it 5 stars is because of two reasons: problems with backlight colors on certain keys, and some keys get stuck on the frame. First, the colors yellow, purple, and white work perfectly on most let's except for the arrow keys. I included pictures for each color at full brightness, where the color on the arrow keys are noticeably darker then the rest of them. This is just a flaw in the backlight, as it's still a functional keyboard. Second, the left CTRL key and Fn key have a bit of a design flaw. If you press those keys at angle going toward the left, the keys can actually get stuck on the frame of the keyboard, preventing you from fully pressing down on the key and thus, no input to the computer. Despite this, chances are you'll hit those keys correctly most of the time. Overall, this keyboard is light, colorful, and feels nice too. However, the only drawbacks are the backlight issues on the arrow keys and the left Ctrl and Fn key get stuck on the keyboard frame.UPDATE (05/30): Keyboard functions normally on Windows, but performs terribly on Linux. I recently installed Elementary OS and found that pressing the numlock key screws up the layout where the only way to deactivate numlock is through entering a command through the terminal. Also, the function keys do not work on Linux, such as pressing F11 does not toggle full screen, but Volume Down. Last straw for me was when it stopped responding at all despite being connected to my desktop. Overall, if you're planning on using Linux, do not use this keyboard. I would stick with a wired keyboard instead to save you the hassle of all the incompatibility this keyboard has with Linux.

Mouse is fast and seems durable

No software required
Easy to Set up

CONS:
I can only think of a couple right now such as:
The mouse is light (but there is room to add adhesive weights)
There is no VISIBLE indication of the comma key (Its marked as a dot beside the left arrow instead of a comma)

All in all i give it a 4.5 just for a couple things but I highly recommend it for its price point. The mouse has a pretty good DPI (1200) and would be perfect for gaming if it were a little heavier, but as i mentioned, that can easily be fixed. Its also a very nice size for a mouse.

Great Keyboard & Mouse for the price!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2019","I'll be honest I bought it for the price because I needed a new keyboard(badly) but could not afford a new one at $50ish. Bought this one for around $18 bucks & some change + it came with a free mouse!

Well let me just say that the keyboard is indeed fine, more than fine actually - It's a dream, although a bit smaller than my last gaming kb. My one smallish thing is I keep hitting the WIN button instead of the Ctrl button - but that's just me.

What I like about this kb is the buttons are a tad bigger & spaced further apart (but not so much that it's a hassle or hindrance. Being spaced a part like they are, makes it very easy for cleaning (Any gamer knows this is important!) No complaints at all so far though I only have had for a bit over a week.

MOUSE: Read a bunch of complaints about the mouse was crap or whatever, well so far so good on that. My twin 15 year olds opened the package and they were less than gentle about it, sending the mouse flying out of the box and onto the floor(it was wrapped in a soft cushy type of vinyl) so I had my doubts.

",,,,Jen,Really clear and descriptive- for young and old!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2020","
  When I was little, my grandma had a baby grand piano. It was beautiful and I loved hearing her play. She would give us grandkids lessons and I remember being able to do basic things and a few songs. Nothing special. I knew someday I’d want to learn more but I grew up and our first born son was diagnosed with Autism (fully functional) and it was recommended we get a piano because I guess a lot of Autism kids do well with learning musical instruments. I didn’t want something to overwhelm him. I saw this and thought I’d see how he, and the rest of the family, does.I feel like it focuses more on the right hand than the left hand, and I feel like it goes into more advanced songs a little quicker than some would like, but over all it’s a good book. It has A LOT of information in it. Most basic, some a little more, but it keeps people moving along at a nice speed and keeps their attention. I think the font is fine- I don’t see it being too big or too small. It came to me in perfect condition. This would be great for older kids, teens and adults. Little kids might do well but it depends on what the parent thinks the child can do and handle. I bought piano stickers to help my kids learn what key is what and I think this book compliments that. I think it’s a great book and I feel like it’ll definitely help a lot of people, young or old.

This book doesn't go far enough explaining the left hand and how to use both hands at once. It's a little confusing. I will use the book for playing the songs in it.

I started looking at a wireless combo and found this one which has resulted in an excellent choice.Truly plug and play, just inserted the USB connector and voila, done as simple as that. It is well built and sturdy, with the click of the keys being soft and precise, no need to push hard. the mouse is also well built and ergonomic although I would have liked it to be a little taller but that is a matter of preferences; it does the job.I purchased a great product, got rid of the messy cables, and no more complains at home.

Backlight options are limited. Each LED is a set color, and although you can change some options with how the LEDs respond, you cannot re-map colors on they keyboard.

Switches are soldered on to the board. I had a nice set of blue switches I wanted to swap out, to give the typewriter style keyboard those typewriter style clicks, but the switches are not swappable unless you want to get out a soldering iron.

Keyboard is solid construction. Nice braided USB.

  I really think this is a cool design but this is not a gamer board. The lighting when the room is dark is amazing and one of the best keyboards in that respect that I've ever used. I like the different settings for how the light flows or waves. I like the knob for adjusting the various settings. I give it 5/5 stars for the visuals. However, the keys are way too soft. They have some resistance but not enough to give me feed back and I find I'm making errors typing. The wrist support is also cool because it has a magnetic connection to the keyboard and you can adjust it. It is the feedback on the keys which really bothers me. I would prefer a keyboard with stiffer keys, with more resistance. If they could just offer this adjustment this would be one of the coolest boards. The round keys are also very different, which takes getting used to. There is no ergonomics to this keyboard. It is very ridged in that respect. All in all, I like it but it is not a gamer keyboard and I need a gamer keyboard.

  Pros: Its really bright and colorful. Its fun to type on. Shipping was quick, only took about a day for them to mail it out. Theres a lot of different lighting effects, and its simple and quick to change through them. The keyboards small, but adding on the wrist rest it feels normal sized. The keys DO come off -- I checked as soon as I could, due to other reviews saying they didnt. They were also easy to place back on the keyboard. The chord for the keyboard is also sturdy, braided, and feels really nice.Cons: It definitely feels cheaply made, very light-weight keys. Will take some getting use to to type on. The colors correspond to their keys and you cant change the colors as far as I can tell -- so no solid color options. Theres also a bit of noise when you click keys -- personal opinion, I dont really care for that -- but I suppose its to be expected in a keyboard with type-writer keys.

I knew it was going to be high quality when i felt the box. Everything about it screams that professional love went into it. You get the keyboard, and a keyboard cover. Extra keys to switch between Apple and Windows. And a keypuller. Good instructions. The keyboard will work USB or Bluetooth. Bluetooth is rare for a clicky-keyboard. USB-C too. Real Esc key too, which is most important. The keys have a really nice feel to them, they travel, and they are nicely spaced apart. My fingers love it. Surprisingly it wasn't as loud as I was expecting. I am used to the loud sounds from the Model-M keyboards, but this one is muted. You can hear it across the room, but it's a muted pounding. That's very nice. It has backlighting. It has more backlighting options than I thought possible. I like the dull red colour as if you're typing above a lava pool. I like the setting where the keys that you type light up momentarily. I like the disco ball effect. I like the wild array of colours. I love that you can turn off all the colours and backlighting to preserve the battery. Within an hour of arrival, this keyboard  became my all-time favourite keyboard. It is the best, the nicest, the most solid keyboard I have used. I totally love it.

However, it is not bothering me enough to stop using this keyboard because I can type so swiftly with it. The on/off button could be on top of the keyboard instead of the edge where the iPad rests.

  I am using this with a MacBook Air, so the function keys at the top don't all apply to my device.  They keyboard is the same size as the MacBook keyboard so is easy enough to switch between the two.  It connects easily.  When it goes into sleep mode it flashes a message on the screen that the keyboard is ""disconnected"" and when you wake the keyboard back up it flashes a message on the screen that the keyboard is ""connected"".  It does take a second for the wake up to happen, so I often start typing too soon.  I like that it uses two normal sized batteries that I can easily replace when needed.  I did some research on ergonomics and found that keyboards should tip away from the user not toward the user, so I took the foamy protective envelope the keyboard came in, rolled it up and taped it to the front edge of the keyboard to get a healthier angle and that is working fine.  I don't use the keyboard a great deal, it is a back up for when I need to work at home.  So far I am very pleased with it.

  This is not a bad set for the price.  The keyboard is very compact, but appears to be well constructed and in fairness this is how it is described.  Two gripes:1. Can't say I care for the mouse.  It is extremely sensitve to touch even when adjusted through the settings on the computer.2. Sleep mode requries 10-15 seconds to reconnect with the computer.  Think this isn't long?  Try it for a week and let me know.Overall this set is as advertised and not a bad buy at all for the price.  Just know that there are limitations and if a tiny keyboard is not for you, neither is the product.Addition:  I did not intend this review to be overly negative, but the seller has contacted me several times to offer a refund or replacement.  They are very customer focused and I apprecitate this greatly.  Just to be clear, the longer I use the keyboard, the better I like it.  Compact, but very sturdy.  The mouse was not to my liking, but that is a personal judgment.  You may love it.

  The keyboard is very nice.  It is made of sturdy steel material and has a very good feel when you type.  Once you get used to the keys and their spacing (just like any new/different keyboard), it feels very smooth and comfortable.  Best part is that it does not have the number block and works very well when I use it on my standing desk, where space is slightly tight.  Also, the performance is good - I had issues with my past wireless keyboards on Windows where there was a lag sometimes.  This Bluetooth keyboard works perfectly without any lag.  If there is a concern that there is no PrtScrn button, Windows provides ways to map hot keys (Shift Win S) and it is not a problem at all.  I haven't used the mouse much, but it feels good.

",,,,William Douglass II,"The Keyboard is excellent for the price, the mouse is okay.","Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020","I bought this keyboard and mouse combo to try out a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse combo for my new pc (never used Bluetooth for keyboards before and wanted to give it a shot).

I really like this keyboard. The keys do wiggle a bit, but the response is great and typing is really easy on the keyboard. As others have mentioned, it's really flat, which is nice. Overall, for a 35 dollar keyboard combo, I am impressed.

Edit: The mouse work fine with bluetooth. I was having issues with stuttering with the mouse when using 2.4ghz wifi, but with 5ghz wifi it should be fine. It is flat and easy to transport. Doesn't feel as nice as the keyboard to use., but it works as you would expect. I use it for MS Office products and internet tasks, couldn't imagine using these devices as gaming keyboard and mouse though.

Edit 2: It's been at least a week and I have used this keyboard quite a bit. These are my thoughts: 1)Response is really nice, click very nicely.
2) Keyboard works fine EXCEPT that in order to use the F keys for their original purpose (for example F7 for spellcheck in Word) you need to press the function key. If you don't use fn+f7 it will instead use the cut command shortcut. This also sucks for games like Warcraft 3 where your F keys are used for Hero units. Really decent keyboard for most applications though to be honest.
3) Mouse - Much better then I initially thought. Besides that problem with the bluetooth signal and 2.4 ghz wifi, it has been nice to use.
4) Long term I would ditch the mouse and go for something else but the keyboard is pretty fun to use when you get used to it.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

  Love it.  Wonderful keyboard feel.  No wires for either the keyboard or mouse.  Both are low profile and fit easily in a bag or briefcase.  Keyboard is metal and sturdy.  This keyboard and mouse have taken the place of my type cover and trackpad on my Surface Go and replaced a look-alike wireless kybd/mouse because of the convenient, no plug in bluetooth connection.  Only two minor detractions:  1 keyboard is not lit like type cover but that can be forgiven for the benefits of disconnected use anywhere.  2 this keyboard was not shipped with a transparent, rubberized keyboard shield which I liked with my prior wireless kybd.  However, the kybd is physically the same and my old cover fits on this bluetooth one.  Both kybd and mouse are microUSB chargeable.  Kybd is a wee bit bigger than the Surface Go type cover and IMHO is easier to type on.

   Beautiful mouse and keyboard! I don’t get what all the negative reviews are about, this keyboard and mouse combo is awesome! I did end up ordering the reddragon P020 mousepad with wrist rest to go with this as I wasn’t a fan of the flat mousepad. The “breathing” issue people speak on is not really an issue at all to me. Yes it changes different colors during the breathing mode which is more of a “not being used” mode. As soon as you move the mouse, it returns to the color you chose when setting the DPI and that color “breathes” which isn’t a deal breaker for me. In my video the keyboard looks more organge but I assure you it’s a beautiful dark red, simply my camera isn’t picking up the color correctly. I strongly recommend this keyboard and mouse combo with the mouse pad! The mechanical feel of the buttons is very comfortable as well

I also like the mouse but I misunderstood the description of the mouse. I feel like it was worded poorly and I don't like that I can't control what the mouse colors do.

It states, ""Ergonomic Redragon M608 Red Backlit Computer Gaming Mouse with Breathing Mode. (LED can be turned off) 3200 DPI (1000/1600/2400/3200 4 level DPI adjustment), 4000FPS, 10G ACC super-fast game engine 6 Button Gaming Mouse; 5 Buttons of the Mouse are programmable.""

So I took that to mean I could change the buttons and that I could set the colors and stop the breathing and cycling through color modes. You can't. I'm okay with the fact it breaths, sort of...I find it annoying, but when I set a color it'll start changing between DPI options randomly. When I emailed the company to ask about the type of mouse that comes with this kit they said, ""We do apologize for this, unfortunately, the M608 does not support a
driver. The DPI can be adjusted by pressing the button below the scroll
wheel.""

So why does my color keep changing?

I'm not saying this is a bad kit for the price I just want people to be aware that the mouse cycles through colors and it DOES BREATH. There is no turning it off... or adjusting any of the color settings. You can pick between Red, Blue, Green, and Purple but it will still cycle after you've picked a color.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

I opted for the silver keyboard/white-grey mouse and I'm very pleased with the aesthetics and performance of both pieces.  The rechargeable keyboard has the quiet click keys much like you'd find on a laptop or iMac.  It is modern and sleek and the design rivals that of Apple.  It is also compact, at 14 3/8"" across -and that's with the 10-key numeric keypad- which is nice for those of us in either an office or home setting and desk space is limited.  The mouse, however not rechargeable, is also quiet click, very responsive and has the three different d.p.i. modes for added accuracy when working on special projects -e.g. anything from spreadsheets to Cricut or other paper/vinyl crafting projects-.  Admittedly, I was a little hesitant to purchase this at first due to the price versus the lack of reviews, but, I went with it figuring worst case scenario I could return it... I Got A Keeper!

  I bought this equipment for using with my laptop while I plug it into external monitors. I like that it *isn't* Bluetooth... Because there's none of that pairing nonsense. The keyboard is flat / slim so I do take it on the road sometimes and it fits in my backpack just fine.  The keyboard and mouse feel durable enough to last a few years, if not more. Smooth tracking on the mouse, and the keyboard has a decent tactile feel, makes a little more noise than my apple keyboard but it's not annoying or anything. Good purchase.

Stops working after a month or two
I bought SEVERAL of these keyboards for my entire office, and the majority of my coworkers have returned them to me after only a month or two complaining that it either freezes (won't type for several seconds, then types half of what you typed) or the keys ""stick"" (not physically stick, but type the same letter ""ffffffffffffffffffffffff"" a bunch after hitting the button just once). We've tried replacing the batteries, thinking that might be the problem, but that doesn't help anything. I've been sticking them in the corner and ordering other models/brands to replace them. Been considering returning them all to Dell and asking for our money back!

",$34.62 ,,,Dan Neuwirth,"Feels good, but has its flaws.","Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2018","
  I'm really torn over this.  On the one hand, it feels nicely designed, the keys feel great, and coming from my prior (10 year old) keyboard I no longer sound like I'm pounding on the desk when I'm on a speaker-phone call.However, the mouse is really ""skippy""---it's almost as if there's interference, it phases in and out of working perfectly.  Sometimes the mouse pointer just skips around and other times it's flawless. The keyboard randomly loses keystrokes.  I'll go back over a paragraph I've written and there will be 30 missing keystrokes, one or two here, one there, requiring me to proof-read absolutely everything I've written.Distance to the receiver is a non-issue: it's line of sight and approximately 18 inches from both; I should certainly hope 18 inches is not too significant a distance.The mouse also does not have any rubberized padding on the underside--as a result, it makes a scraping sound on the desk during movement.  My prior mouse (Microsoft Basic Optical) was whisper silent during movement.I'm torn on this, as I REALLY like the look and feel of this combo.  But it just ""misses"" the mark and it feels like I'm spending a lot more time rereading what I've written.  I'm wondering if I should have spent more on a Bluetooth unit rather than this proprietary wireless one.UPDATED 06/07/18: I've tried everything to resolve the keyboard skipping issue, moving the receiver, replacing all batteries with good fresh ones, etc).  The USB dongle is now 12"" away from the keyboard and it still loses about 1% of the keystrokes.  My productivity has been dramatically reduced with this keyboard/mouse combo as everything I type, I have to go back nd edit (there's one--I tyed ""and"" and it came out ""nd"", and ""typed"" not ""tyed""---see, this is my new life with this keyboard).  I love Dell, I love the FEEL of this keyboard, but I've given up on it and I'm replacing it with a different brand.

",$34.62 ,,,Shopper C,Your slightly better than average run of the mill budget-friendly keyboard with no critical complaints,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2017","
  Great product, especially for the price. I have mostly good things to say; so, I will start with the worst part--which is that the mouse clicking noise a little loud.  Other than that, the wireless works without delay or difficulty from around my office, although I haven't tested it for distance. Key's are thinner than your average keyboard, built in and flat on top to somewhat resemble the mac-style boards although they feel like a normal keyboard with the springiness you would expect. That being said, the keys are are easy to press and especially quiet for such a cheap keyboard. Your noise level will be somewhere in between tapping and clicking (unfortunately, it's the backspace key that's the loudest, haha), To add context onto my review, I am used to mac keyboards and wanted something wireless for my work PC that would look a little cleaner. My work PC had a pretty basic dell keyboard that wasn't wireless and had the trapezoidal keys.  It worked fine, but I figured for the price, why not try this one? I am satisfied.  I am a little bit particular when it comes to keyboard typing but i'm not extremely sensitive. So, those who want a mid-level keyboard that isn't a complete piece of junk will find this to be quite nice but, obviously, has no special features and is the same size and structure as any average old keyboard.

Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480 – Black – Works with Windows and Mac Computers, Android and iOS Tablets and Smartphones






",$34.95 ,,,,A Love/Hate Relationship (But Mostly Love),"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2016","PROS
+ Key spacing is comfortable, especially for touch typing
+ It has a dedicated delete key (although it could be larger); I mention this because I’ve come across one too many keyboards which omit the delete key in lieu of the backspace key to conserve space
+ Pairing with Android and iOS was quick and easy
+ It seamlessly switches between three devices without breaking a sweat (I have it set up with an Android tablet; an Android phone; and an iPhone--haven’t needed to re-pair any of them)
+ The bottom has non-skid bumpers so it stays in place while typing on a table or other surface, even when on a slight incline
+ Keys have great tactile feedback while typing and the home keys (F & J) have raised indicators
+ It respects most common keyboard commands (ex: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Z, etc.)
+ Great battery life (I’ve yet needed to change my batteries after using it near daily for over a month--I am, however, careful to switch it off after I’ve finished using it)

NEUTRALS
* Every so often, it will miss a keystroke as though it can’t quite keep up (I’ve listed this under neutrals because it happens so infrequently as to not be problematic)
* This thing is hefty and thick (nearly 1/2"" at its thickest part); some may view this as a positive (as it’s less inclined to tip while typing) and some may see this as a negative (because it can be a bear to carry around)
* Keys are not backlit (I know this wasn’t a listed feature, but I’m pointing it out because this keyboard would be a million times better if they were)
* It requires two AAA batteries rather than using a built-in rechargeable battery; some may view this as positive (as they can be purchased almost anywhere) and some may view this as a negative (because it means more potential waste and clutter)
* No illuminated indicator light when it’s on (it will light briefly when you switch it on and it pairs, but the only way to know whether you’ve left it on/off is to flip it over and check the power switch on the back)

CONS
- The keys are noisy; I don’t mind this so much, but they’ll definitely be heard if you’re typing in a quiet area
- The low battery indicator is on the bottom of the keyboard rather than in a more visible location (the logic of this baffles me)
- Area for the tablet/phone is only so deep and only so wide, which means you’d be hardpressed to use your tablet or phone with a protective case (even a thin one) unless you have an ultra-thin device
- Because the recessed area for the tablet/phone is only so wide, it means you can’t adjust the angle of the device and it’s at nearly a 90 degree angle which could be uncomfortable for some

I have a love/hate relationship with this keyboard. In so many ways, it’s absolutely fantastic, but there are others that simply irk me to no end. That said, I do find myself reaching for it quite often when I need to draft emails, letters, or other writings which require more than a device’s onscreen keyboard will comfortably allow. In fact, I typed this review with it.

If in the future, though, Logitech comes out with an updated version which allows for a deeper angle, using a device in its case, backlit keys, and quieter typing, I’ll be first in line. In the meantime, I’ll just need to make due with this one.

As I continue using it, I’ll update this review as necessary. Before then, if you have a question about the keyboard or my experience with it, please leave a comment and I’ll do my best to answer.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

I love this keyboard! It was super easy to sync, it's a veryy good size, easy to type, and I can connect it to multiple devices. It has all the keys that a PC has, but I'm using it on an iOS (iPad Air 2), which I love. I don't know about other people, but one of the many reasons I refuse to get a macbook is the keyboard, and this absolutely solves that problem for me. I have my iPad Air in one of those stand cases, and even with the case on it fits in the slot brilliantly (just not when the case is completely in --- see pictures), and at such a great angle, it's perfect. My tablet even stays in the slot and doesn't fall out when I have the keyboard leaned back (see pictures)! I've seen classmates of mine with keyboard cases, and while I can see how that's useful, the case either seems bulky, hard to open, or flimsy. While having a whole separate keyboard doesn't really help with the bulkiness (it's thicker than the pictures seem), it's not super heavy (although it is a little bit heavier than I thought it would be, it was nothing I didn't very quickly adjust to), and it seems to be very durable. Will update with survival timeline once I've had it a little longer and it's been exposed to my backpack and school.

",$34.99 ,,,QuillBall,"It's a keeper for me, great set for the money!","Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2016"," I was hesitant about buying this keyboard and mouse set due to some of the reviews, and the fact that I am very picky about my computer input devices. Honestly, I pulled the trigger based on looks, as I wanted a white and silver set to blend in with a room that was almost all white. There just aren't many keyboards/mice that are this color, so I figured I should give it a go. Well, so far, I am glad I did.

Measurements: The keyboard is approximately 14.5"" wide and 5.5 inches tall. The thickness (from your table to the top of the keyboard) is roughly 3/4"" at the top of the keyboard, to 1/4"" at the bottom, so the keyboard is slightly tilted. The mouse is about 4.5"" from top to bottom, and 2.5"" from side to side. The height is 1/4"" at the front tip of the mouse, approximately 3/4"" in the middle, and a bit over 1/2"" at the bottom.It is difficult to measure the height, as it is curved to fit the hand, but to me it is a flatter feel that the Microsoft mouse I was using before.I thought this would bug me, but it's actually way more comfortable.

Weight: I don't have a scale for actual weight, but the keyboard is light enough to carry with one hand easily, though not so lightweight that it moves or slides around on my slick wooden table. It does not feel cheap to me, and seems well made. The mouse is very lightweight, slides around my table easily without a mousepad, only has a barely detectable rattle when shaken.

Lag: There is no lag with the mouse at all. It is quick to move around the screen, zips along like a speeding bullet. The keyboard has no lag that I can tell.

Keyboard sounds: Many people have said this is ""quiet"" and some people have said it's noisy and clacky. To me, it's more of a thunk but not quite. It's not totally quiet, but it's not annoying me either. I'd say it's a matter of tolerance for anyone. I added a video so you could hear the keyboard. My phone is right next to it, and the room is perfectly quiet so you might get a feel for how loud it is. I'd say adjust your speakers for someone talking in a normal volume, then listen to the keys.

Overall Impressions: I like this set. One pro about it is that you only have one usb dongle to use for both the mouse and the keyboard. So if you are short on usb ports, but need both a regular keyboard and a mouse, this is a nice feature. As stated, I am very picky about my input devices. I don't like to hammer on keys, I like them easy to push but not mushy. These keys are springy and responsive. They are slightly hard to push down for me, and my hands and arms get fatigued after long bouts of typing, however, I have muscle, tendon, and joint issues all over my body, so this is not unusual for me.

The keyboard may fall asleep, but I haven't noticed if it has. It has always sprung right to attention when I start using it. The mouse does go to sleep but all it takes is a press down on the scroll wheel or other button and it wakes right up. Better than a dead battery in the morning. There is an on/off switch, but who remembers that? Both keyboard and mouse take AA batteries by the way. Two for keyboard, one for mouse.

The color on the keyboard is an aluminum or silver for the base. The buttons are white, with very dark gray letters and numbers. They have black for the function key and the function symbols like mute, and volume. The mouse is mostly white, with a silver border going around the perimeter and silver accents on the scroll button, along with a small center button I can't seem to figure the use for.

I am using a Windows 10 PC, this works fine. The drivers seemed to install fine, I had no trouble setting it up.

I've just had it a couple of days, but I am pleased enough that it's a keeper. The only thing I feel is missing is a side button that I could use to map a zoom in/out function to, such as my Microsoft mouse has. I really miss that, but otherwise I have had no other misgivings. A solid set for the money in my opinion.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

RATEL Wireless Keyboard Mouse Combo, 2.4GHz Slim Full-Sized Silent Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo with USB Nano Receiver for Laptop, PC (Black)






",,,,Joseph,"Classic layout - perfect for muscle-memory, mouse makes no noise at all","Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2019","
  I was having issues with my previous wireless keyboard/mouse combo after using for a number of years now, plus it was a very loud keyboard.  My wife told me she could hear me typing all the way across the house, and coworkers told me to mute my phone on conf calls since it was too loud while people were talking.  With this new RATEL keyboard, you can't hear it unless you are sitting right next to me, and even then it is fairly quiet and wouldn't bother anyone.  No one can hear me typing when I'm on calls anymore either.  I've been running this new keyboard for a week to give it a spin, and am quiet pleased.It took a day or so for me to adapt to the chicklet type keys, my previous boards have always been full-height keycaps, and hence the noisy clacking sounds (not even mechanical keys, just a regular keyboard).  But by the end of the first day, I found I am typing away at full speed again having adjusted to the shorter keypress depth required.  Actually, it's kind of nice.  They feel a bit like the type of keys on laptops.I am a programmer and I type all day long, but there are a few things that are critical to me - and anyone who is accustomed to the standard 104 key layout:  This keyboard is designed correctly and doesn't insert the Function Key the left of the spacebar like most manufacturers are doing now.  Instead they have properly added the function key to the right of the keyboard, and further they kept the right-click (context menu) key.  So, muscle-memory works right out of the box.  I have tried other keyboards, where there are now 4 keys to the left of the spacebar, and they have placed the function key where the windows key goes, and windows where alt goes, and then alt in that space below the ""C"" key where they spacebar used to extend to... what a pain.  With those other keyboards, I spent half the day fixing typos, popping the wrong menus, etc. because when you type all day for a living your muscle-memory kicks in and your fingers just go to where the ""right key"" is supposed to be for the action you are performing - except when the manufacturer moves the keys it trashes your ability to type full speed.  Sounds petty right?  Try it sometime.Anyway, THIS keyboard is the proper layout for us old-school people who are very used to the classic keyboard layout.  This fits the bill, and on a scale of 0-10 where 0 is silent and 10 is a gamer's clackity keyboard, this is a 1 or 2.  So for me, it's great.The mouse - I might mention this vendor brags about long battery life.  they are probably right (I'm only a week in at this point).

",,,,Paul,"Easy Set Up, Plug & Play, Extremely Silent Keys and Mouse","Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2019","I am Truly Impressed with this product.

* The Quietest Mouse I ever used in my life - I bought several individual mice over the years always looking for one without that annoying clicking. Never thought I'd get exactly what I was searching for combined with a Keyboard. Someone sitting next to you won't even know you're clicking it. Perfect for those late nights or library use.
Very Responsive with no drops in connection. Smooth roller wheel. Can be used in either right or left hand comfortably. I just love it.

* The Keyboard is equally impressive - Extremely Quiet Keys, No Clacky sounds that you usually get from those ""Big Brands"" accessories. Keys are evenly pressed even if you don't hit it center. All keys are very responsive. Operates and feels like something alot more expensive than what I paid.

* The Packaging: Came in a neatly packed box. Straight and easy to understand instruction manual even though it is not needed for set up.

* Plug & Play: to start using both keyboard and mouse, just insert the batteries and jack in the USB transmitter into a PC or USB Hub. That's it. No switches on either device to turn off, it shuts off automatically and turns back on by just pressing something.

* What I use it for: bought it to use with a USB hub. I convert my Note9 to a desktop with Samsung DEX.
Note9 connected to a USB hub, connected to HDMI TV, controlled with this wireless Keyboard and Mouse.
Everything works like a charm.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

RATEL Wireless Keyboard Mouse Combo, 2.4GHz Slim Full-Sized Silent Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo with USB Nano Receiver for Laptop, PC (Black)






",,,,Ricardo,"TL;DR: best you can buy for the price, despite minor complaints. 4.5/5","Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2019","I've only been using this for a few days now, so I'll update my review if my initial impressions change.

This seems to be the best keyboard mouse combo at the price point. The mouse feels light and (in my opinion) a little cheap, but as far as I can tell it's well made, and it functions perfectly fine. My hand is about an average sized male hand and while this mouse isnt small enough to make my hand hurt at all, it could stand to be a bit taller to make a better fit. I didnt really like that the mouse uses a AA battery while the keyboard was a AAA because that forces you to buy 2 packs of battery instead of one if you dont already have them lying around. I'm sure the listing says it somewhere but I dont remember seeing it. Also not to crazy about neither one of them having a power switch. I understand it goes into a sleep mode that conserves battery life, but I like having that hard on/off switch as I'm sure others do.

Despite my aforementioned qualms, I do quite like this combo. The mouse is so quiet that you could easily use it inches away from a light sleeper without them waking up, and the keyboard keys are very quiet as well. Speaking of the keyboard, it of course has all the standard keys and media shortcuts you'd expect it would, and it's got a sturdy build. It's still just plastic, but it shouldn't break just from accidentally dropping it on the floor. As far as that 'cheap' feeling I mentioned with the mouse, I dont get that feeling with the keyboard so that's nice. Also, because I noticed someone asking about this int Q&A section, it DOES have the home kitchens on the F and J keys, photo attached.

All in all, I'd absolutely recommend this product as it was the most inexpensive full keyboard/mouse combo I found that didn't have either terrible reviews or extremely mixed reviews. Can you buy a better one than this one? Absolutely. Can you buy a more inexpensive one for the same quality? I highly doubt it.

4/5 because of the minor complaints I had at the beginning of this review, however it's worth noting that I'd actually rate it 4.5/5 if I could.

If you read the whole review, thank you and I hope it helped.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  The material does not feel cheap on this keyboard and the mouse. The mouse is pretty quiet as the post was mentioning. The keyboard is quiet and feel like a office keyboard. Definitely does not feel like a gaming keyboard. but it is not as loud as the gaming keyboard that I had. I like it it feel really smooth on the keyboard. One thing that I think they can improve is to have raise platform in the back of the keyboard just like other keyboard might have.The mouse feel nice to use and touch. I wish the scrolling can feel little smoother tho. Other than that, I think It is a good deal. specially with the rechargeable battery which is great, save you more money.

  So far so good. been using this keyboard for the past three days so bear that in mind. So far no cons, just pros. The keyboard and mouse came fully charged which was a pleasant surprise. As far as ease of use, everything was pretty much plug-and-play, really seamless. The keyboard itself is lightweight and not clunky which I appreciated. I prefer sleek, light designs. One thing to flag though is that the keyboard uses a Type C charging cable and not the typical USB port to recharge (it says so in the description). The box comes with a Type C charging cable, so no worries, but these aren't as common as then conventional USB cables (although they are becoming more common). I haven't had to charge the device yet so I can't speak on the battery life but so far so good. Really solid product. Met all my needs.

",$51.99 ,Microsoft,,C. Barker,Update: the problem with this keyboard is...,"Reviewed in the United States on October 23, 2019","
  Update:I loved this keyboard at first but, after using it for a while now, there is a huge problem.  Look at the right and left halves of this keyboard.  Notice how much WIDER the right side key area is as opposed to the left side.  The problem is your right hand has to stretch frequently to hit the backspace, =, underscore and so on.  I'm a software developer and hitting these keys is a frequent thing.  This has caused a repeated-use problem on the outside-right of my right hand.  I'm selling this keyboard and trying out the new Logitech Ergo K860 to see if it works better.  The other issue with this keyboard is it's just spread out.  This means you have to reach more which means more repeat use injuries, and I have LARGE hands.  The other thing to note on ALL of Microsoft's ergonomic keyboards is pressing the keys is kind of like walking through ankle-deep water.  The keys should have a click-on and bounce back feel.  These keys feel mushy and require effort.  This makes my whole hand sore after a while.  If you want one of these keyboards cheap, mine is for sale!I am writing this review on this keyboard now!  I had the Microsoft SURFACE ergonomic keyboard prior to this keyboard (the gray one) I never could get used to that keyboard.  The flat surface of the keys never agreed with my fingers, the spacebar had an annoying squeak and the bluetooth was irritatingly slow to connect.  With this keyboard the keys form a cup and my fingers land exactly on the keys I expect them to.  I have way fewer typos and though the keys have more travel and feel a little more klunky than crisp I am able to type much much faster.  I do prefer the chicklet style keys that are slightly clicker but  I'm not going to get that key style with a cupped layout like this keyboard has.  I also like that this keyboard is wired so no waiting for bluetooth connects.  The wrist pad on this keyboard is very nice as well.  I'm definitely ""at home"" with this keyboard, it feels comfortable and familiar without a huge learning curve.  Thank you Microsoft!  I would like to see backlighting on this and a tiny bit more crisp feel but those are not dealbreakers by any means.UPDATE:Backlighting would be very helpful on this keyboard.  Sometimes it's difficult to see the Fx keys.

  You'll really want the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard for Business (5KV-00001) or the Surface Ergonomic Keyboard... trust me on this one.  The distance you have to press each key is simply ridiculous, the keys are really really deep so you'll fumble through typing quite a bit.  Also, it's slightly larger than the Sculpt, so your hands have to move more to type which I don't think is a good thing.I've had and tried nearly every Microsoft ergonomic keyboard out there... as someone who's been typing for about 40 years now, you should have an ergonomic keyboard if you type a lot.

Here are my first impressions for this new version of the MS Keyboard.

I was expecting a lot from this new version and now that I have received it, I'm somewhat disappointed.

The keyboard overall looks more stylish and of higher quality, but keys are just slightly better than on the previous version, as they are still too stiff for someone who types fast. The space bar doesn't get stuck anymore, but it still feels too stiff as well.

The hand support area is made of some sort of foam which feels nice at touch and while typing.

The left and right sides angles seem fine as far as the hand and wrist orientation are concerned.

I think this keyboard should be fine for most casual computer users, but for somebody who spends many hours each day typing, the key quality is the most important element, and that's why I'm only giving three stars.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

  I'm an IT guy I work with Servers. Servers don't always have a keyboard or mouse handy. This foldable keyboard comes in very handy. It's well on every system I've tried it on. It came with all the USB cables needed to attach it to anything from headless servers to cell phones and tablets. It's also Bluetooth compatible. The keys are membrane switches but they don't feel mushy they are every bit as nice as my Laptop keyboard and much better than the Apple Butterfly keyboard keys.

I purchased this keyboard to use on an occasional basis but it's so nice I've considered using it as my daily driver.I'm being picky here but the reason I didn't give this foldable keyboard 5 stars is that there are two keys the ""T"" and the ""V"" key which are a different size from the rest. It's not a big deal but it is very annoying when actually typing. It's easy to see why they had to shrink those keys, and I don't know how they should fix it.Lastly, my wish is that there was a case to keep it in. A cloth bag or something to keep the cables and keyboard together, and keep it all from getting scratched when I put it in my tech bag. Also, a built-in cell phone stand or notch, or tab,  would be handy to have quite often too. I'd pay extra or purchase a bag, or Hardcase with cell phone stand as an accessory.

My main issue is the lack of 4 keys to the left of the spacebar -- and in an Apple Mac layout (Function, Control, Option, Command). But I get why it is that way--because there's not enough space.

I tested this out with my iPhone X (Bluetooth) as well as my MacBook Pro (supplied USB cable) and it works great. It folds up super compact, too--which is the main point of this keyboard.

  Jelly Comb Wireless Keyboard with Track Pad.This is a GREAT product. It works for Windows, Mac, iPhone/iPad, and Droid devices. It’s slim and folds up small enough to fit in any bag or even your back pocket! The battery life is pretty good and the Bluetooth connection remains in tact without dropping the signal at all. It has every functional button and I use it everyday. There is a slight lag (barely noticeable) in  recognizing mouse swipes but is on point with keystrokes. I highly recommend this product for yourself (especially if you travel a lot) or it would make a great gift for any light weight techie.

  IF you need a bluetooth keyboard that you will use on a hard, flat surface, for just a few moments - this keyboard will work for you.  My experience is that after 20-30 minutes, the battery fade leads to intermittent bluetooth disconnects, the folding keyboard has no way to lock open, so it is constantly flexing, and some of they keys ""stick"" and repeat.  My strong suggestion is to find another keyboard to try.

  It's a tenkeyless mechanical keyboard; This key layout and position is one of the most popular among both laptop and gaming keyboard. Very responsive and tactile, comparable to the Razer Green switch, but the Green switch is a bit stiffer. Letters are cut through the key, not printed on so you don't have to worry about fading. Keycaps are coated in anti-grip; Caplock key has an on or off light indicating status. Most of the font on the keycaps are neutral and not too aggresively gamer-looking.

This case is awesome! The leather feels sturdy, and the color came out really nicely. There are no scratches at all.

The keyboard (which I’m typing on now) is so lightweight. It feels like it weighs nothing at all. The only issue with the keyboard would be that the delete button is in a different place (up on the same row as the numbers, called “backspace”). Additionally, the keys are pretty small so if you’re a clumsy typer, like I am, it can take a little getting used to. The keys are not backlit, but I can see them in the dark from the light of the screen. The magnet is super strong. With the keyboard attached, I can lift the whole thing without it falling off. When the keyboard is attached, closing the case does not turn the iPad off. However, with the keyboard removed, opening and closing the case turns the iPad on and off. The keyboard paired to the iPad really quickly in my case. I’m planning on using this to carry around my iPad for school and so far I’m really excited, because of how lightweight it is and how well everything works.

The iPad case has 3 grooves where you can prop it up, but I’ve found that you can kind of place it anywhere and it doesn’t slip, so fingers crossed that stays that way. It performs exactly as it says it will. This cannot be propped up with the iPad vertically though, just fyi.

The camera and flash of the iPad fit perfectly in the case, and I can take pictures with no difficulty.

Overall, the case is sleek, the keyboard works wonderfully, and the case fits perfectly wrapped around with or without the keyboard. Would recommend!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$33.99 ,Fintie,,B-Side,This makes your ipad legit look like a composition notebook.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2019","At as glance it looks like a dollar store notebook. But its hiding your iPad. The material is smooth vinyl and so far its stood up to scratches and being lugged around in my backpack. The inside has a smooth felt like lining and the magnets holding the keyboard are robust enough to stay in place. I get nothing but compliments on this thing.

The only two cons are that:
A) I have to move the keyboard forward when the case is fully expanded in order to use the kickstand function of the case. Sliding the keyboard back in place is sometimes cumbersome, but necessary for you to fold it back up.

B) This case locks your iPad in the horizontal position. I have seen others that allow you to rotate the tablet vertically. I sometimes find it tough to use the fingerprint ID function horizontally, and prefer some apps in the vertical format, so I have to fold the case to let the whole thing stand vertical and separate the keyboard all together. Not a deal breaker, just a small annoyance.

The battery life on the keyboard is good, not great. The keys are a good size for the compactness. Pairing was very easy.

If you are looking for a fun case that's not a boring, plain color and that kinda camouflages your iPad, I highly recommend this.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  This case and keyboard combo is great. The keyboard is of good quality and doesn't feel cheap. I read that some reviews said the keys were too cramped but I don't see that as a problem at all. The case also has a good feel to it and it looks great. I like that the keyboard is removable and the magnets do hold it very nicely. The small issue I have is that I need to carry my ipad from exam room to exam room as I see patients and having to close the case is a problem with the keyboard in its proper position for typing. It needs to be moved every time closer to the ipad otherwise it won't close correctly. If you intend to use the case and keyboard in a more stationary fashion, this is ideal. I still use mine and just fold the ipad over the keyboard and keep the ipad facing up as I carry it around. It is not too heavy or bulky. The set up of the keyboard with the ipad was also very easy and standard for bluetooth devices. And I have had the keyboard case for over a week and have yet to charge the battery. Overall, for the price of this keyboard and case, I give it five stars.

  My iPad cover w/keyboard arrived on the date promised.  Packaging was secure in an Amazon box.  Inside that box the iPad cover was enclosed in a plastic wrap.  The keyboard, charge cord, and operating instructions were within its own seperare box very secure.  Installation was ultra easy, just pop the iPad in place in the cover,  Keyboard setup instructions were clear and took less than 5 minutes before I was able to use everything!  At first I didn’t think I would like the idea of the magnetic backing on the keyboard (not visible of course).  But it secures the keyboard in places on the cover so it doesn’t move while you type, and this I love!  It is removable so that you don’t have to have the case to use the keyboard.  While the keyboard is mini, the keys are very comfortable and as a transcriptionist, I can type with so much ease and flow with minimal correcting.  It all folds up into what looks like a regular iPad cover, easy to transport and convenient to open up and work anywhere.  My color choice is Rose Gold - and it’s true to color, but I’m sure all other colors are prettywell,I am very satisfied with this product and the seller.

",$36.99 ,,,Mac,Very nice keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on December 13, 2019","My first day...
It worked right out of the box. No tinkering. Very nice feel. I'm already 50% more productive.
Pros:
1. The feel of the keys are great. No loud clackety clack. Just the right amount of pressure needed to press the key.
2. The second Windows/Command key on the right of the space bar is absolutely a must. This in itself is worth it's weight in gold.
3. The long plus key in the numeric keypad is great. Thanks for making it how it should be.
Cons:
1. I think the Fn key would be better placed next to the right Control key instead of whatever key is there currently. I don't even know what that key does.
2. This is NOT an aluminum keyboard. It is painted plastic to look like aluminum. There is a certain amount of unwanted flex experienced in this keyboard due to that fact, especially near the front edge near the center of the keyboard. The center foot or standoff on the bottom of the keyboard is apparently not quite as high as the ones on the bottom right and left along the front of the keyboard. This is what seems to cause the unwanted flex of the keyboard.
Honestly the Cons are minor compared to the great positives of the Pros.
On a side note. The mouse is a cheap piece of crap. However I did not buy this product at all thinking in the mouse. I will continue to use my Logitech mouse that I'm used to. If quality mouse is what you're looking for then keep looking.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

  I wanted to use my 22"" monitor and avoid using my laptop keyboard. I have some bad keyboard habits and inadvertently touch the laptop finger pad, which goofs up my document or disturbs my train of thought. I had a Logitech wireless keyboard from the Dark Ages and it was pretty clunky. I saw this keyboard/mouse combination offered on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. I'm very happy I did. This keyboard is just what I wanted.First of all, it's easy to set up. Plug in the USB receiver and both keyboard and mouse are connected. Only the mouse needs batteries (2 AAA’s, which you supply). The keyboard is fitted with a rechargeable battery. Recharging is quick and easy with a mini-USB cable. It can be charged through a port on the laptop or through an electrical adapter. I'm used to my ergonomic mouse so I put the mouse that came with the keyboard in my drawer of electronic toys as a backup. Before it went in the drawer, however it tried it. It is comfortable to use and works great.The full keyboard is quiet and responsive. My keyboarding skills seem to have improved because I don't worry about the finger pad. I like the keyboard’s 10% slant, which allows me to work without severe wrist bending. I have yet to run out of battery. I plug in the keyboard when I think of it, which is every few days or so. This keyboard/mouse combination is well-designed and in my opinion worth every nickel.  iClever has a winner.

",$26.99 ,Rii,Multimedia,,"So far, this is one of the best lighted keyboards that I have purchased","Reviewed in the United States on February 8, 2018","So far, I am very much impressed by this keyboard. It can be used with any device that the USB dongle for the 2.4 GHz dongle can be plugged into. This would include laptops, Windows PCs, some android TV boxes, MAC computers and laptops, etc. I have a couple of the RII keyboards, but I like this one better than the others that I have. The features that I very much like about this keyboard are:

1 - Even without lighting, the lettering on the keys is large and easy to read.
2 - The colors available are bright and very easy to see in the dark. I have others that the lighting is so dim it doesn't help much.
3 - You can easily toggle between the lighting colors of blue, red, and green with the press of a button.
4 - When typing the key touch is good and doesn't click. The keyboard isn't much smaller than a full sized keyboard, and I had no problem typing normally on it.
5 - The touch pad replaces the numeric keyboard of a full sized keyboard, and can easily be used instead of a mouse. In my testing, I found the touch pad to be extremely responsive, and it worked as well as the touch pads on any of my laptops.
6 - Drivers were installed automatically on my Windows 10 computer, and all of the FN keys worked flawlessly.
7 - The charging cable and USB dongle can be stored in the keyboard so they are always handy and can't be lost.
8 - If you need a longer USB cable for charging, an extension is supplied.

So far, I haven't found anything that I don't like about this keyboard, and, believe me, I tend to be critical when I can. I can't yet attest to how long the charge lasts as it hasn't run out as yet. If it does, it isn't a problem to connect it to a USB port on my computer for charging.

   Before you buy a gaming keyboard with lights, ask the people who bought them to see whether the light is bright enough. I got one that is mechanical which I like quite a bit but the light is not bright enough so I am having hard time finding the keys I need from time to time. Finally I decided to donate that one and get another one. This one is bright, all the keys are clear to me. The lighting is also soft, subtle, not loud.

The fact that it has a usb-c connection for charging the internal battery is HUGE. The reaponsiveness of the keyboard is great enough for gaming and no delays where encountered. The downfalls of the keyboard are really features the manufacture needs to add. Those being:
#1 The usbc charging cable that comes with it is to short it isnonlt a foot long and needs to be closer to 6 feet.

#2 The keyboard lacks adjustment legs, purchasers can add pads to the bottom, but the manufacturer should really add variable adjustment legs to the back bottom of keyboard. Thats is a feature that is on nearly every keyboard produced.

#3 The keyboard is simple and easy to use, however the documentation that cMe with the keyboard was poor. I thought at first i had ordered the wrong keyboard and was severlybput off by the 1 foot cable to connect, qith no batteries to put in, it left the user feeling like the cable was needed. After discovering the battery is internal andncould be recharged i was much happier.

#4 the manufacturer needs to add usb ports to the back of the device to power share to other devices, such as headphones, gaming pads, or mouse charging station. This is a nice to have but doesnt break the ability to use the keyboard.

  I have been using this product for a week, and I have very little complaints. First, the positives: the keyboard is absolutely stunning and has great build quality. The colors are minimal but sleek and chic, and even though the keyboard is thin, it is very sturdy. However, this brings me to a point that may be a pro or con depending on the person. It is quite heavy so the portability is compromised. However, I only use this at my office desk so this product is perfect for me. I would not say this is an inherent flaw in the product, but it is something to be aware of when selecting for your specific needs. It's also great that there is no need to purchase batteries because it is rechargeable. I will say, however, that recharging is a bit annoying for me personally since I am such a heavy user, but depending on the setup of your workspace this may not even be a problem at all. The keys are essentially silent, which is wonderful. The feel is nice as well. Overall, I would highly recommend this product.

  The keyboard on bottom in photo is my old one, the one on top is this one, I put my hand there to give you an idea how small.  A full sized keyboard to me means the keys are all aligned properly not skewed, which these are off placement,  and the size should be comparable to a full sized keyboard, which this is not, though it also means all keys are available,  which these are, but not in a productive way, as I type 90 wpm and I need to for work, but this is not acceptable for my needs.

Keychron K2 Wireless Bluetooth/USB Wired Gaming Mechanical Keyboard, Compact 84 Keys Tenkeyless RGB LED Backlit Aluminum Frame for Mac Windows, Gateron Blue Switch, Version 2






",$94.99 ,Keychron,Gaming,Dan,This is the best compromise I can find,"Reviewed in the United States on September 23, 2019","First off, unlike the other review currently up right now I don't find myself making any typing errors that I can blame on the keyboard. I use this mostly for work and as such I type A LOT, pretty much all I do is write e-mails all day, chat with coworkers and do some small amount of programming. Programming of course can't have typos in it, otherwise things simply don't work. Likewise, my e-mails and instructions to other people are very technical. A typo could make all the difference in the world with what I am trying to convey.

If this keyboard did not type 100% correctly for me then I would be sending it back. That simply is not the case.

If you're wondering; I am connected via Bluetooth to my HP laptop that runs Windows 10. My laptop is line-of-sight from the keyboard; no physical obstructions between the two and they're maybe a grand total of three feet from each other.

Anyway, so that covers probably the reliability in typing, what about the rest? Well personally this is the only keyboard I have seen that comes close to ticking all of my boxes, both in needs and wants:

-Mechanical
-Wireless
-84-key
-Aluminum deck
-USB-C

So why the compromise? Well, they aren't Cherry switches, but at this price you won't get those. Nevertheless, I don't have any complaints with these Gatereon switches myself. They're very smooth and feel great to type on. Can't say I have much experience with Reds at all though, but I like it.

Secondly, while it's USB-C they stuck the connector on the side of the keyboard. Who does that? It's weird. Not that I plan on using it plugged in, if I need to recharge it then I'll just plug it in overnight, but still...

Lastly, the wireless. It'd be nice if it had a dongle transceiver like Logitech products since they work oh so well but alas it uses Bluetooth. As I said before, I use this for work, I don't game but I do intend to do a very tiny bit once every never. Having said that I have seen enough times where this keyboard has had to catch up with my typing (and it's never missed a key I've pressed either), however infrequently that happens, even if it were just once an hour it'd be enough to frustrate a gamer. Then again, if you bought this for gaming, you are only fooling yourself if you think it, or any other wireless keyboard, would be good for that.

Edit: one last thing worth mentioning for the BT wireless is that it is set, by default, to a power-saving mode. That is that for ten minutes of inactivity the keyboard goes to sleep, but maintains connection. It's never had an issue waking up. Related to that, whenever I start up it connects immediately and flawlessly, never had any issue with it connecting it just works (no power cycling or going to Settings, etc.)

But! It IS USB-C! Even if it's in a weird position. It IS wireless, even if it plays catch up sometimes. It IS mechanical, even if it's not the gold standard of Cherry switches. Also, it IS 84-key: inbetween a 60% and a TKL if I had to describe it. It DOES have an aluminum deck as well, which feels nice to the touch, machined very well, and just gives it a nice, unique property. Also, it has lights, if you like RGB lights. I don't really care for that feature so I leave it off anyway.

It's only been a few short days I have been typing on this but so far I love it. Not sure how long the battery will last but if I can remember to I will report what it lasted me of what is basically day in and day out of typing full time.

tl;dr: I love this keyboard, it does everything I wanted out of a wireless, mechanical keyboard, but I would just fix a couple things here and there.

Edit 10/07/19: I just now noticed that the LED on the side has started to blink which indicates it's battery level is no more than 15%. Also, I did lie and ended up turning on the backlit LEDs to see if I liked them and I do. Mine were fairly low consumption as I only kept them on the second lowest brightness setting, they were solid red, and not reactive to any sort of input just were lit at their set brightness constantly. I also had the normal power saving mode left on (ten minutes of inactivity and it sleeps, IIRC) and I never once switched off the keyboard. I did keep my laptop on the whole time, minus the first weekend where it was turned off, so nothing for the keyboard to connect to anyway.

So from receiving it on 09/19/19 I used it every weekday for work where I am at my desk, typing the majority of the time (to be fair I also do a fair bit of research as well and do have phone calls, meetings, etc. where I am generally not typing). I would count today and the day I got it as half days, so it's about 13, eight hour days of steady usage before it got to 15% (the light may have been on longer, but I only noticed it now). Take it for what you will. I am going to see if it can last the next hour and a half before I stop working so I don't have to bother charging it. I mean, I got it because I didn't want to see cables. If I only have to charge it every couple of weeks after work then I don't mind one bit.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  I use this for work, and I love it so far. I have another similar one that is clickier, but this is satisfyingly clicky while being a little quieter. (Luckily I have my own office.) I like the fact that this one has the three shortcut keys above the number pad. The only reason I took a star off is that there are virtually no instructions on how to change the colors. Even after looking online for more detailed help it took me at least 20 minutes of trying to get it the way I wanted, and that ended up being by chance.

  It really does give off the feel of typing on a typewriter. Unfortunately, my only experience with a typewriter was a mondernized version of it that if you got the backspace it places the white out over the text for you, that was owned by an old associate of mine from middle school.The keyboard itself comes in a big box that holds the actual box with the keyboard in it (and trust me I thought it was going to go through a Matryoshka doll moment). Inside the box is a key twizer to remove the keys if needed, and the keyboard itself cover with a sheer soft plastic covering the keyboard and the attached is cord. It also works well when playing games or as a primary/second keyboard for laptops and desktops alike.

",$69.99 ,DoubleW,108,aberwah,Great,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020","Pretty much got what I expected with this so that's always about as much as can be expected unless you have particularly low expectations of a product. I hoped this would be as good looking in person as in the pics and it definitely is, plus a bunch more. It has downsides but it's not as pricey as the big name keyboards and after a couple months it's still working fine, plus if you like the style i honestly don't know an alternative that matches it remotely on the modern typewriter sort of look it has - I think maybe once I saw an expensive keyboard made out of retrofitted keyboards, with all the issues their keys had an the less than optimal key layout and slope of the rows putting the top row far above the bottom, and the recreations would lose some cool points to solve some of these issues and supply some useful keys not on a real vintage typewriter. Stuff like that is really for hipster types to look cool and retro without care for the functionality of it as a keyboard for much of anything because computers 'are lame' or something, right?

Anyway, besides liking it, some pros and cons:

Pros:
- Fully functional in all ways described, and as easy as plug and play
- All the controls and color / effect / brightness options are available as keyboard commands, with no accompanying software required or complicated set up processes for relatively limited function options (unlike some big, expensive players - looking at you; Corsair (especially), and Logitech. Realistically programs that allow multiple effect layers (like e.g. -!a color / colors, a wave effect, a typing effect like a single color change or ripple / ""pebble in a pond"" effect, that's about as much as anyone can process or would look okay). You could add more but it either wouldn't be noticed because colors are similar to those used, or you can add jarring sudden bits of unexpected colors in a way that just diminishes the quality of the existing effect; Multiple constant changes clash as do multiple typing-reactant set ups. Basically, the combo of a set main color / colors / animation and the available addition of something like the ripple effect is plenty of movement and honestly more than what looks good w the style - I have a warm white / yellow and orange type background color and a typing effect in a cooler, brighter / whiter color scheme and it is more than enough, the reaction animation might be excessive to some and with this old style coloration of a warmer (2-3k kelvin) light temp that old lightbulbs were pretty exclusively made in, simple works well. You can do a rainbow and crazy stuff if you like though, and without touching your computer. - You also can independently control the side light
- The mechanical feel of the keys is nice as are the satisfying click-clacks it produces, as long as you don't need to be quiet - home office yes, work office probably not unless you're the boss or at least have a private office.
- Price is reasonable for quality and capabilities, at least where some keyboards are $150-200 for (seems to me) imperceivable benefits in response time etc.. and the software which can also set macros etc. easily but probably isn't worth it for non-gamers, and I doubt they're getting this anyway because it can't possibly be the best layout for that.
- Seems well made, no issues
- Really makes a nice look in, for example, a more traditional office (I moved into a house with an old fashioned wood paneled office and found a large wood / brass antique desk with inlaid green leather top on consignment to buy, and it fits the look perfectly - only the monitors look somewhat out of place.
- Not the quickest to type on, the key shape and design aren't going to set record WPMs for you, but if you use the number pad more than the keys like me and normally average 120-180 wpm you could drop to 50-100 or so wpm but that's fine for many uses including many work needs. On that..
- Full size number pad, very comfortable and easy to use, trading options as my main vocation, I need it most and it's not failed me or even caused a typo.

Cons:
- Wired
- Save the customization keys",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Redragon K580 VATA RGB LED Backlit Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Macro Keys & Dedicated Media Controls, Onboard Macro Recording (Blue Switches)






",$62.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,Angel,"Amazing Value and Quality, Feels like any other High End Keyboard out there!","Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2018","Full disclosure: I returned this keyboard because I did not like the blue mechanical switches. I never realized how clicky and loud those are until I owned one.

The only knock I have against this product is that it is not available with different switches. I ended up getting a Corsair keyboard with Cherry MX Browns, which have the tactility of the Blues, but with more quiet operation.

In my opinion, this Reddragon keyboard is every bit as good as the pricey ""high end"" Corsair keyboards. It has a really solid feeling chassis. The feet have good grip and don't slide easily on my desk. The keyboard software is more user friendly than Corsair's CUE application. The RGB lighting is beautiful and adjustable to your liking. The RGB light strips on the sides are a very nice touch. The media and volume controls are all there and work properly in Windows, which is a requirement for any keyboard I buy.

If you like Cherry MX Blue switches, I see no reason to spend more money on a Corsair. The quality feels the same to me.

Reddragon also include four different switch types in the box with two of each; Red, Blue, Black, Brown. So, I know Reddragon have brown switches they can use. If anyone from that company is reading this, please offer this keyboard with Brown switches in the future. I would happily purchase your product again and recommend it to others.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$62.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,Anna,Finally A Slimmer Macro + Media Gaming Keyboard!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2018","The Vata is truly a keyboard that has all of the features I needed to game and work.
The ""on the fly"" macro recording is great for work and is incredibly useful.
The software downloaded from redragon's site is simple and very useful to reconfigure any key or set macros.
I did not buy the keyboard for the RGB functionality but it is a great touch to be able to match your color scheme with other equipment.
Pros:
1. Outemu blue keys: they are light to type on and very loud and clacky. I put clear dampening o rings on them but it made no different since the outemu switches are slightly different than cherry switches.
2. Dedicated media keys: I love being able to change songs on VLC / Winamp / Windows Media Player.
3. Macros: You can use the default G1 - G5 to record or use the software to set any key to be recorded. The customer support was great in helping me understand this before I purchased this keyboard. I was not able to find any review that mentioned this.
4. RGB: Seems like there are tons of customization options.
5. Side RGB: I turn it off but it does help light up my mouse-pad slightly at night.
6. Volume wheel can be used as a LED brightness wheel!
7. Slim: This keyboard sits a little bit lower than my other mechanical keyboards which I love.
Cons:
1. Removable switches basically break the switches and I suggest avoiding this feature. I think it is great that they ship a few different switches to let us swap however the plastic housing on these outemu switches is too fragile. I was able to swap out a few switches to browns however I broke the default installed switch housing using their guide and the tool correctly. Good thing they provided extra blue switches I could use in the future.
2. Media keys stay lit even when computer is turned off.

This one looked like it had even more features than the Corsair, and at a much better price. I was a little reluctant to try Outemu blue switches compared to Cherry MX, fearing that they would be ""off brand"" and inferior in some way. But they are better! The ""click"" is slightly louder and more satisfying. The activation force is perfect, with better clicky feedback that the key has been depressed. Some people feel that the switches are too clicky. But, if you are ordering blue switches, that's what you want! It's like ordering the hottest hot sauce and then complaining that it's too hot. Typing on this keyboard is the best typing experience I have had since the original IBM keyboard.

The keyboard itelf also feels equally high quality compared to Corsair, but at half the price. Aluminum body and solid plastic keys. Excellent volume rocker that doubles as a brightness control for the keys. Multiple LED colors and patterns, including user-definable. Five macro keys. I would recommend this keyboard very highly.

Pros:
Much better price than the competition with equal build quality
Outemu blue switches, which I found to be actually superior to Cherry MX
Cool color patterns with the LEDS, and adjustable patterns and brightness
Macro keys
Switches are replaceable, and comes with some replacement switches, in case one dies (assorted colors too, so you can ""try out"" other switch colors)

Cons:
No USB passthrough, which I have never used with the Corsair, since it is in the top edge and inaccessible anyway if you have your keyboard in an under-desk slider",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Wireless Bluetooth Keyboard, Mini Portable 84-Key Typewriter Retro Round Keycaps Keyboard,Compatible with Android, Windows, PC, Tablet-Dark, Perfer for Home and Office Keyboards(Pink)






",,FELICON,Multimedia,R4LDZ ✅,Nostalgic look keyboard brings back nice memories,"Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2020","
  Before I start my review, if you are figuring out how to put this keyboard in pairing mode, press FN + C  (see my screenshot).I was looking for a  tenkeyless bluetooth keyboard when I stumbled on this keyboard.  The round key caps reminds me of my fun high school years when everybody were still using typewriters.  The nostalgia is what urged me to buy this keyboard.  I'm glad I did.  I am currently using this keyboard as I type this review.The packaging is plain and simple.  Inside the box was just the keyboard and a quick start guide (written in Chinese).  Immediately upon touching the keyboard, I fell in love.  The key caps looks and feels very premium just like my $150 gaming keyboard.  Unlike gaming keyboards, the base of this keyboard is made of hard plastic instead of aluminum, which is fine because it makes it lighter and portable.  The tactile feedback is very satisfying that I could type on this keyboard the whole day.  If you are wondering about the tactile feedback, it feels like Cherry MX Red switches.  It has a soft and silent key press that has slight resistance before the actuation of the keys.  Although this keyboard can connect to multiple devices, there is no shortcut key to switch between devices.  Since I am only going to use this on a single device, I don't mind about fast switching.  My only gripe on this keyboard is the user manual, it is written in Chinese.  Good thing I have an older bluetooth keyboard that connects the same way (FN + C), and when I tried it, it works.  For  battery life, this keyboard automatically sleeps and wakes up when you press the keys, so at 2 hours per day actual usage, the battery can last more than a month.Overall, I love using this keyboard, it feels great.  The nostalgic design is very nice to show off.  If you are looking for a high quality keyboard with a vintage look, this keyboard is highly recommended.

I was a bit scared that the keys would be painful to press on due them being so raised, or that it would take a lot of pressure to type anything. I have a condition that causes repeated dislocations in the small joints of my hands, so this is especially a concern of mine with any keyboard. If it requires too much pressure, there’s no way I can do apply it without dislocating multiple joints. Thankfully, this keyboard is not like this at all!!!!

It’s gentle to press, the colors are fun and the design is unique, all while being functional and easily transferable from device to device. It looses a star only because I have one complaint. It does not, as far as I can tell, have a power off button. It seems that the idea is just to leave it on all the time, only to have it shut off when it puts itself to sleep then waking up when a button is accidentally typed while moving it to a new table or something. On a similar note, mine did not come along with or contain an instructional guide on how to connect it to your device. I used the information provided in this listing to this and it was by no means super difficult, but there’s no way I would be able to have figured it out without the help of the instructions, since connecting requires pressing two specific keys.

No instructions like others have mention but quite easy to get on. Function + C, to turn on. Needs 2 AAA batteries.
It will ask you to press a couple of keys to recognize language. Obviously and since this is a one size fits most, some of the punctuation keys will not match what you are used to, but you'll be typing away without any problems after an hour of use.

Size is very comfortable, same as my laptop. See photo.
Very mechanical feel as you type, something you gotta get used to cuz fingers get tired a bit faster.

My BIGGEST complaint... The mint green keys are actually grey :( bummer! I actually chose this color because of the mint green, but will keep anyway cuz its beautiful anyway, but be warned.

Razer Ornata Chroma Gaming Keyboard: Hybrid Mechanical Key Switches - Customizable Chroma RGB Lighting - Individually Backlit Keys - Detachable Plush Wrist Rest - Programmable Macro Functionality






",$79.00 ,,,Miss M,A fabulous keyboard for transcription! But on the high side of mid-profile with quality ssues (UPDATED  8/2018),"Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2017","Top half of this review is an overall performance overview. Bottom half is an update about quality control and slow replacement issues that made me change this from a 4- to a 3-star review.

I didn't purchase this keyboard for gaming, just straight typing. I work in transcription and have many of the same problems gamers do. I type faster when the keyboard gives me the right tactile feedback, it can't be too loud, the key spacing needs to be on-point, and even ghosting is a problem. The Ornata is one of the best keyboards I've ever used and has noticeably increased my productivity.

Key Feel: I'm a heavy-handed typist, meaning membrane is generally easier for me to use. However, I love a good click. Having a 'tickity-tack' sensation with depression helps me stay 'in the zone' while I type. When I'm not working, I type fastest on my Macbook Pro keyboard. Macbook keyboards are a sort of membrane/mechanical hybrid like the Ornata, which is the biggest reason I went with it. You get that 'click' while still having gentler touch. The Ornata has a more aggressive 'click' than a Macbook keyboard, but it's still that hybrid sensation.

Key Height: The Ornata advertises itself as a mid-profile key on the Razer website (I don't know why all the professional reviews call it 'low profile'; it definitely isn't even by gaming keyboard standards). I liked that idea. With low-profile keys (and especially full-on chiclets), it can be too easy to hit multiple keys at once when typing at max speed. However, the keys on the Ornata 'float' above the profile of the keyboard base. The end effect definitely isn't as dramatic as high profile keys, but it's still on the higher side. I expected something shorter. Key height can play a big role in hand fatigue, especially if you're a heavy-handed typist. If they set the keys even a little bit into the base of the keyboard, or make them just a touch shorter, it would be closer to 'mid-profile.' The trade-off you get for this key seating is easier cleaning (see Cleaning down below).

Anti-Ghosting: When typing quickly, I often have a problem where I'm hitting the next key in a sequence before my finger has fully ""disengaged"" the previous key. On every other keyboard I've ever used, this means ghosting. I'd get 'thes' instead of 'these' and so forth. The Ornata prevents that, and it significantly improves my work efficiency. I spend less time correcting the 'thes' and 'tht' and 'thoug's I normally have to deal with.

Key Volume: I'd rate this as a mid-volume key. It's much quieter 15-year-old, 'out of the box' desktop mechanicals that pretty much go ""THUMPITY-WHACKITY,"" but it's nowhere near as quiet as my Macbook. I can still transcribe without the key volume making it hard to hear my files, but a friend of mine who works on the phone noted that their customers would absolutely be able to hear their typing. To me, the volume is too loud for a hybrid key. It seems like it's making an effort to make a sound. I think that's what bugs me the most about it. It's inorganic; it doesn't feel 'native' to the key feel. If it was even the same volume but less sharp of a sound, it would be great. If you're looking for a 'stealthy' keyboard, this definitely isn't it.

Programability: TBA. I haven't messed with this yet, but I use a number of macros while I work. I'll update this review after I've fiddled with it. The one thing I will say is that the keyboard updates are a mild annoyance. Your keyboard will stop working until you restart your computer, which I found out the hard way.
As an aside, the Synapse software frequently leaves a lot to be desired. I'm on the beta for the new version. It works better, but the ""upgraded"" main interface is enormous, slow loading, and ugly. Lots of negative space for no good reason. It also lacks the customization capabilities you would expect. Everything about the keyboard is customizable, but you can't customize the interface to only show the options you use. The Chroma (color-change) customization screen is still awkward to use, though it works much, much better than it used to.

Color & Color Programming: Phenomenal. The color is just icing for me, but it makes my work day a lot more interesting. It's rich and lovely with a good color-to-color shift. There are a few problems with programming it. The first is that the software needs work, though the beta of the new Synapse works much better than the old one. I still have problems with the keyboard abruptly resetting the color cycle to default after updates.

Cleaning: Someone asked a question about this and made me realize this keyboard is absurdly easy to clean. I have dogs that shed nonstop; fur tends to build up between keys in other keyboards. Because of the 'floating' set and spacing of the keys, I don't get as much fur between the keys, and what does get in is a cinch to get out. I can tease pretty much anything that falls between the keys out with just a napkin or my nails. It would be effortless to clean up with canned air or just a paintbrush. Even if something was stuck to the membrane, you could dampen a Q-tip or a stiff paintbrush and get it right off.

Overall, definitely recommend for heavy-handed typists that have a need for speed and accuracy. I knocked off a star for it overcompensating on the click loudness and the keys being taller than they should be for true 'mid-height.'

UPDATE, reduced from 4 to 3 stars:
After having the keyboard for about eight months, the LEDs started glitching out. Razer customer service personnel is fantastic; I've dealt with them twice now, and they're great. I sent my original keyboard back to Razer for a replacement. I appreciated free shipping both ways, but it was ground. It took almost a month between shipping it to them and getting my replacement.

Six months after I received my replacement, the black coating is starting to wear off the center of my space bar. I have a .5 inch section where it's totally worn off an a 2 inch section where it has a heavy gloss from wearing down and is about to wear off. I had a shoddy laptop keyboard's coating last a good five years longer than this. The weird thing is that this didn't even happen on my last Ornata after six months of an equal amount of use.

I contacted Razer customer service. I got prompt, professional replies, and the agent checked with a particular department about my issue. Unfortunately, this is considered normal 'wear and tear,' and my warranty is considered to be from my original purchase date.
Razer does offer replacement key caps, but they were out of stock when I contacted customer service.

You'd think a gaming keyboard would have key coatings tough enough to withstand heavy, rapid key press abuse. Just six months is pretty pathetic. This could be a quality control flub, but if so, the Ornata definitely has QC issues; this marks the second time something has gone wrong with a brand new Ornata within less than a year.
If this were a $30 keyboard, I wouldn't care so much. But you can't have a $100 MSRP on a keyboard and have quality issues like this, let alone replacement shipping that's as slow as it is.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$79.00 ,,,Lucifer4pres666,"Good, but theres some BIG buts..","Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2018","
  Ok, it's a decent keyboard.  I'm going to break down several elements.FUNTIONALITY: This is where I encountered issues.  Never in my life have I ever had to lubricate a keyboard, and certainly not one practically new out of the box.  I was breaking out the teflon spray on q-tip inside of 2 weeks.  Like, come on razer... it's a $90 keyboard and you're cutting corners on lube? The stuff they used was way too high viscosity and the keys would stick.  Works fantastically and smoother than new when you add a dab of teflon.RGB LIGHTING: VERY large selection of colors, just about any you can imagine you can select, and individual color coding is awesome for hotkeys across multiple games.SOFTWARE:  ATROCIOUS.  just plain BAD.  Fine for basic color coding and whatnot, but advanced lighting effects interfere with each other.  I tried stacking 2 wave effects in a relatively simple way, and it wouldn't adjust the speed for whichever was on the bottom layer, throwing off the sync.Other: the wrist rest is COMFY, but extremely delicate.  In a few weeks the faux leather coating has already begun to deteriorate.  However, I really like the cord management, there are 3 slots under the keyboard for you to direct the wire either left, right, or out the back.Conclusion: it's a decent keyboard, I like the tactile click despite the issues I've had with lubrication, and not as loud as traditional mechanical switches.  That all being said, my next keyboard will be from Corsair.  I've been a fan of Razer since they launched, and I've watched the quality of their products slowly but surely deteriorate over time.  It's probably time for me to pick a new favorite gaming brand.

",$79.00 ,,,Oredge,It has a Magnetic Wrist-Rest,"Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2018","The Wrist-Rest is MAGNETIC! I was a little upset when it didn't come attached to the keyboard; I thought it was going to slide around a bunch, then I found out it was magnetic when I nudged it up to the keyboard.

This keyboard feels smooth. As the other reviews said, the keys make noise, but it isn't loud or obnoxious in any way.

The click of the keys is actually a little satisfying to the touch when you press them.

I've never been disappointed with Razer.
Let me tell you a short story of my experience and you will see why I'm such a fan:

I really like the gamepads (Razer Orbweaver Chroma).
Well, I had one where the wrist-pad was sent with way too much sticky-paste, so much so that the rubber pad slowly slid off of the gamepad. It was annoying, and after 2 years, the pad just wouldn't stay on at all, so I removed it.
I was at the end of my warranty (2 days left to expiration), but I shot them an email telling them about the problem. I had already even discarded the rubber pad, so they couldn't even verify that I was telling the truth. They said they'd over look it though, ""Send it in, we'll send you a brand new gamepad""

Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard, Jelly Comb Wireless Slim Rechargeable Keyboard with Round Keycaps for Laptop PC Tablet Smartphone Windows/MAC OS/Android/iOS System - Black and Gray

I've been searching for a cute round-key keyboard... don't ask why. I saw the awesome Logitech one, didn't love the price point, and went searching for something similar. Jelly Comb has a bunch of cuuuuuuuute keyboards, and while I'd have preferred blue, my setup is mostly white and black and gray, with a black mouse, so I went with the dark gray/black, and it looks seamless.

I've been using it with my gaming setup, just testing it out with its ability to move from email to web browsing, to straight up gaming. I've read so many PC gamers say to AVOID wireless/bluetooth-connected peripherals at all costs, but I've used this keyboard every day for hours on end since I got it and it's been AMAZING.

Never loses connection, hasn't needed a charge in a week (what? how?) and I have forgotten to turn it off a few times overnight... eek. It's soft, the keystrokes accurate and easy, and while mechanical keyboards are typically more common for gaming, I'm having no issue with the transition from my clunky mechanical model to this one. For reference, I play a ton of Overwatch, so it's legit gaming that requires WASD and various other keystrokes. It's compact but comfortable, and I have yet to mis-click. Thought there would be a learning curve, but there simply isn't!

I also love how thin and flat it is, and it takes up little space on my desktop, which is lovely. I need to get a photo, but it gives so much room for my cat to lay in front of the keyboard and sleep while I'm playing and not bother me whatsoever. Good for her, good for me.

  The first thing I want to point out is the battery life! I've been using it for the past 3 days and it still hasn't ran out of battery. It stops connecting once I'm off for. around 5 mins but whenever I want to reconnect, I just press the keys and it will reconnect in 5 seconds.  I really like the texture and style of this keyboard. I especially love that I can type my notes on my laptop when I have online meetings, as that software make my laptop extremely slow. I also love that they gave us a screen protector. That was very considerate, but the screen protector sometimes gets stuck between the keys when I type ahahaha (the key is too high, which causes the keyboard to stick to the keyboard with the protector). I thought the keyboard was broken in the beginning, using it with the protector, then realize that it’s fine (man I’m traumatized). But having a keyboard protector is really really considerate! I can put it on when I eat while watching dramas, and protector is an add on! So this is really a reminder for you to try the keyboard without protector before you send the keyboard for repair!

Bluetooth connectivity is fantastic, and absolutely no technical issues.
Build quality is amazing for such a low price.
Switching between devices is seamless.
No issues with missing keystrokes.

Cons:
The keys are a larger than I expected. The size is not too much of an issue as it's roughly the same as the apple keyboard, This takes some getting used to because sometimes I'm hitting multiple keys at the same time. Not only this but the amount of pressure required to press the keys is low so it's even easier to hit multiple keys. This might not be an issue for some however for those who are used to laptops they'll probably be used to smaller keys and distance between keys.

",,AULA,Gaming,DR. Baque,DOA - did not work at all,"Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2020","So, I ordered it very excitedly because some of the positive reviews... I did read many bad reviews but hoped I wasn't going to be a part of that statistic...

I was so happy of it's arrival that I began an unboxing video. As soon as I opened it, it felt nice to the touch, the keys had a nice clickiti-clakata sound to them and smooth layout. It just felt comfortable, albeit a little to light, but I'm not gaming, just need it a back-lit keyboard for my office when it gets dark.

But sad to say, the shocking truth came the moment I plugged it in to my computer. It just kept on blinking and nothing else. At first I thought it was my computer or Windows 10... so I changed ports, nothing. Then I plugged it in to my imac... same thing... Then I plugged it in to my macbook pro AND.... same... so, had no choice but to return it as it was a useless paperweight that flashed incessantly but would not even output any letters on the screen. nothing worked. dead, useless! did I say useless? oh and also, USELESS! I'm sure it's a great keyboard.. IF and WHEN it works... but sadly I cannot confirm that.

What is so difficult about a regular back-lit keyboard for office use? I don't want anything fancy, I just want to type and not spend more than a mere keyboard should cost.

  The keyboard arrived a day earlier than it was supposed to, which is fine by me. I did not need it for gaming but did need a new keyboard. Just plug it in and use. Simple as that. I like that you can choose a color and it can be on all the time or you can have it on a strobe kind of mode. The keys are easier to use than the Logitech Keyboard I had. Like I wrote, plug it in, which means it is not a wireless keyboard. That is the only negative thing I have to say about it.  Even though my wireless was slightly cheaper, I prefer this one, which I have owned for less than eight hours as I type. I use my computer for work as well as leisure. My old keyboard got to the point where keys stuck as well as the space bar causing massive typos. I could have gone to the store and purchased a new one, but it did not have the light feature and the ones that did were way more expensive than this one.  If you do not mind that this is not wireless, than this is a terrific deal for you.

Do you ever type the '/' or '?' keys, you'll be holding FN+3 for five seconds every time you want to switch from arrows to '?' key. Do you want to change this default behavior? LOL, nope. There isn't any software that will let you change this. Boneheaded.

Why not just use the FN key as a toggle and allow you to quickly access layers while you hold it down? Then go back to normal after releasing? Well, that would be the smart thing to do, what most other 60% keyboards do, at least that would provide some ease of use over not having customizable software.

",$14.99 ,NULL,,Jack Hammerly,Raspberry Pi 3 B+ Wireless Keyboard works great!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 17, 2018"," Decided to give this a try for a small 7"" touchscreen OSMC/Kodi build on a Pi 3 B+. While the device does have a 7"" touchscreen, good luck trying to deal with bash while not having a keyboard handy. After receiving this keyboard, I have a feeling once it's installed it'll be used more often than the touchscreen, which is an pleasant surprise.

I saw this item, the reviews and the price without reading much. I pulled the trigger anyhow.

Once received, I was delighted to find that it has a rechargeable battery, and a wireless dongle. I was about to start googling for drivers, github and setup when I plugged in the small dongle and found it worked right out of the box. Very impressive! Even the media controls worked with Kodi and there was no raspi-config, localization configuration or anything else. It just worked.

I figured I would top it off on a charger before spending anymore time with it, and that was another surprise. It needed about 5-10 minutes of charging as the battery was already good to go!

I read another review here before posting this review regarding the device not working with keyboard shortcuts in terminal. That makes sense, as CTRL+X'ing out of something would be difficult. God forbid you have to use Vim. May as well just pull the cord or throw it in the garbage and start over.

Typically if I needed to have SSH access after an install I'll use an SSH client on my phone, and usually not the device itself. REMEMBER TO CHANGE YOUR DEFAULT SSH PASSWORDS PEOPLE!

However, if you're looking for a basic - and I think that's not really doing it justice - keyboard/mouse combo with media controls, and you're working with a GUI and NOT looking for a keyboard/mouse combo for bash, programming or anything in an office/home PC setting, this is the way to go. The price is great!

The device feels sturdy enough. I'm several hours in of active use and the low battery led has not come on. There is no direct way (as far as I can tell) to check the battery percentage. Nonetheless, should it get low it charges via micro USB which you probably have many of laying around.

The battery case also has a small bracket to store the dongle. That's where you'll initially find the dongle when you take it out of the box. The touchpad allows for multi-touch gestures for more complicated interactions too. Overall, it's a great little device, and for this price I see no reason to hesitate. I'm trying to think of some cons to list here with my review, and honestly I just can't think of anything.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

I originally considered small footprint keyboards. Got this on a flash deal and I love it. Replaceable battery pack is well marked and appears to be a common model (in case you need to replace it). Mine stays charged for about a week before needing recharged, maybe less if left on. Charges in an hour or so via USB. Buttons are easy to use and have a clear tactile detent when pressed. Great range, haven't had any issues immediately connecting when switching off and on. Construction seems solid - no loose parts or weirdness. Windows 7 immediately recognized and no need to install drivers. Has an interesting feature that accelerates mouse movement to better get around screens with its small trackpad. It isn't perfect, but it is a thoughtful addition.

My only complaints are that the backlight will seem to randomly stop working after self powering-down, and I have to use the function key combination to get it working again, not a huge deal. Also, if left for a few minutes to sit until shut off, you must push one of the buttons to get it back on. This button press is registered by the machine, and can therefore lead to unwanted effects on the device it is connected to, like pausing/starting a video.

I wouldn't want to write a novel or play video games on this, but for couch surfing or HTPC, it is very functional.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  The battery says its fully charged but as soon as you take it off the charger the blue light starts blinking which the manual states means the battery is low. While the blue light is blinking the remote is completely useless. The only way to prevent this is to keep it on the charger which defeats the purpose of having a wireless keyboard.

",$16.95 ,,,Dragon Reviews,"Sturdy, easy to use and comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2019","Just received this this morning, been using it for about an hour and feel confident delivering my first thoughts.

I had a previous keyboard similar to this. That product lasted about 6 months before failing. I am confident that this one will last much longer.

By comparison, this product is much sturdier and heavier, the material feels to be of a better quality.

The touchpad is lightly textured, so you are aware you are touching it without looking at the product. The individual buttons are made of a gripping material that even if your hands get sweaty, as they do when gaming, your fingers don't slide across and fumble the keys while in a sensitive PvP situation.

My two complaints are that the directional buttons and media controls should be reversed. As a right handed individual it feels unnatural to be using my left hand to be making adjustments when typing and editing comments, although I suppose I am quickly getting used to it; also I do not like the dual finger drag for scrolling. It hops back up a little bit when you remove your fingers. On a small dialogue box like this review section, you have to scroll way below the section you are aiming for, and it becomes a guessing game. Yes, I can edit the size of the dialogue box, but games generally do not have that option for their chats. The previous handheld keyboard I had used a raised line on the right side of the touchpad that you lightly ran your thumb down, and I feel that that was a much better implementation.

It came well packaged and protected, with no wiggle room inside the box. The instructions are clear and easy to use - it is obvious from some of the wording and tense errors that this is a foreign made product, but the team put in actual effort to have their instructions be understandable by English speakers, which is really nice.

I have been using it straight out of the box for close to an hour and a half, two hours, with the phasing LED option and the battery is working just fine.

Buttons are very well marked, clear and concise even when using colors like blue and purple, in bright or low lights.

I am very pleased with this product, and if my earlier caveats do not bother you, I suggest you purchase this product!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$16.95 ,,,Abner Rosenweig,Smart buy for your SmartTV,"Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2019","Typing with Amazon's Fire TV remote made me feel like Stephen Hawking struggling with a cumbersome text-to-voice machine: I had to go through the alphabetic keyboard letter-by-letter. It was an ordeal to type in the simplest of titles. Using YouTube or Netflix on this device was frustrating enough. Using a Web Browser was, of course, out of the question.

This all changed with the PonyBro USB Keyboard.

Plugging the wireless USB dongle into the back of my FireTV (not all FireTVs or Smart TVs have a USB Input so make sure yours does), I gained a new mini-keyboard remote that makes using FireTV apps 10x easier.

The PonyBro is stylish, with its multi-color backlight option, it's responsive, it's very intuitive.

It also works as a game controller.

With Amazon's remote on the FireTV, it was like I was going through life one-handed. Suddenly, with the PonyBro, it's like feeling the comfort and dexterity of two hands for the first time.

I use it for work and gaming. The games I’ve played are Destiny 2 is one of the more fast paced games I’ve played and it has a good reaction time. I at least didn’t notice a delay personally, however I’m not a pro player either.

Wired but no need to charge/change battery which is great. The wire is long enough for most work set ups so don't worry about length.

HOWEVER, the only downside is that Fn+Delete to delete backward on the macbook does not work on this keyboard. it's not a dealbreaker considering all the pros mentioned above, but something to keep in mind.
Also, while it is USB C (which I adore), it's not the high quality USB C version that comes with Apple products. There's a slight extra pressure that you have to exert to plug it in to the laptop, but once it's connected the connection is smooth, no disruption yet.

I wanted a low profile keyboard for work, and wasn't looking for something with the dedicated number keys on the side.  This keyboard fit the bill perfectly.  It honestly feels solidly made, and is the size of an average laptop keyboard, so it is easy and natural to just jump right in and start using.  Don't get me wrong, if you are used to using a full size keyboard, you will notice a size difference, but just barely.I also love the fact that it has an internal battery that can simply be recharged by the included charging cord (same charging cord for most Android based smartphones).  Some reviewers said that the keyboard comes fully charged.  I did not find that to be the case, although it fully charged in about an hour.  In my experience the battery life itself has exceeded my expectations.  I've been using it for about 2.5 weeks on the same charge and it is still going strong.  It stays on nearly all the time because I almost always forget to turn it off when I leave work.The tiny rubber pads on the bottom are extremely grippy so if you are worried about the keyboard moving around on you while you type, trust me, it will not.  The keys also have a nice, responsive springy feel to them and I haven't had a mistype yet.  I didn't check the functionality of every key, but by now I have used almost every single one, and they work perfectly.I also love the fact that it uses a USB dongle as opposed to bluetooth.  I have used bluetooth keyboards in the past which were okay, but always seemed to be finicky, or simply take too long with connecting after turning the keyboard off and on.  This keyboard connects instantly, and stays connected.I am going to be a little nit picky now, and mention a couple of things I would like to be different.  Firstly, the power switch location.  It is located on the under side of the keyboard.  This doesn't really affect the use of the keyboard, as it is a low profile, clicky slider.  It seems solid, and doesn't contact the surface of my desk while using the keyboard, but since it is on the bottom, you have to pick up the keyboard and turn it over every time you want to turn the keyboard on or off.  This isn't a big deal, and I know it, but I think it would have been much better if the power switch was located either one the side of the keyboard, or along the front edge.  Again, nit picky, but still.The other thing that I cannot wrap my head around is the orientation of the volume keys.  The volume decrease key is on the right, and the volume increase is on the left.  This is backward from every keyboard I have ever used.  This seems like a small discrepancy (and yeah it is), but every time I adjust the volume, I will turn it up when I meant to turn it down or down when I meant to turn it up.  Notice the orientation in the included pic.I feel like I have had a chance to really put this keyboard to the test.  The only thing I don't yet know is how long will the battery last.  Truthfully, if it died while I am typing this review, I would have no complaints.  The charge has lasted for quite a bit of use already (much more than my previous wireless keyboard).  The nit picky things I mentioned are just that, and wouldn't make me think twice about buying this keyboard again.  It looks great and works perfectly, and I am much more impressed with it than I expected to be.

  This is, by far, the best compact wireless keyboard I've used, and I've tried and owned quite a few of them. The back is stainless steel, which makes the keyboard very sturdy. The touch of the keys is great. It's very easy to type on it. It almost feels like micro switches on the keys, without the annoying clicking noises. The keys are not squishy like most cheaper keyboards. It does not feel cheap or flimsy at all. It stays connected and does not go to sleep like other wireless keyboards out there, which is a huge plus for me. Also, it has a rechargeable built-in battery, so you never need to change the batteries. It charges on any micro-USB charger.This is the best wireless keyboard I've ever used, hands down. If you can deal with not having the number pad, you'll be very happy with it!

  I was looking for a compact keyboard with no number pad, chiclet style keys, wireless but not Bluetooth. I wanted backlit keys also, but could not find any keyboard that met all of these requirements, so backlit was the feature I chose to do without,I own the Logitech K810 Bluetooth keyboard, loved the layout and backlighting - layout is the exact same as this Arteck. With the Logitech I had issues with the Bluetooth disconnecting several times a day and also randomly sending a string of letters so I would have to turn it off and back on to make the letters stop! Also after a few months some of the keys were sticking as well. At least once a week I would have to delete and pair the keyboard again as well.  The Logitech cost 99.00 when I bought it. but the Bluetooth keyboard was not cutting it for me and my work . This is why I decided no more Bluetooth keyboard.This Arteck keyboard was the closest I could find to what I wanted but the price mad e me worry it would not be good quality. I was pleasantly surprised!  This Arteck is better construction than the Logitech, much lighter and the keys have a better feel when typing.  Although there is no backlighting , I'm finding that was not as important as I thought.  This keyboard is amazing. I love it.  If this keyboard had backlighting I would give it 10 stars. But it is perfect anyway, exactly as advertised and excellent construction. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.

",,,,Chris Garling,"Good layout, battery, wireless -- some issues with light key presses","Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2017","
  There's a lot of things I like about this keyboard. The battery is long lasting (at least two weeks), internal battery (no AAAs), great wireless connectivity over Linux and Windows (keystrokes arent missed when it ""wakes up"" from idle). I prefer the dongle wireless implementation to bluetooth, because in my experience it results in better wireless connectivity (never drops signal, no missed keystrokes, doesn't need to reconnect on startup / wake from sleep, etc.) I like the keyboard layout, as the function key provides access to keys I want to have but rarely use (like page up/down), without them needing to take up dedicated space on the keyboard. I also like the chiclet layout.Only thing keeping this from a 5 is that fairly regularly I'll feel like I bottom out a key only to have it not register. I know it's not a wireless issue, because it never happens if I type harder. I generally don't pound the keys, so this happens more than I would like. Typing harder does solve this issue. If you type lightly, you may have some issues with this board (or maybe it's just mine). Overall though, a very nice product.

",,WisFox,Multimedia,Linda Ferrier,Exactly what I needed at affordable price,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020","
  This little keyboard is exactly what I was looking for. I do transcription and every couple of years wear out the keyboard on my laptop and need to replace the keyboard or the laptop, but the computer is usually still fine. I wanted an easy and affordable keyboard to use with my last 15-inch-wide laptop to have as a backup computer and this is perfect. It sits right on top of the old keyboard, or in my lap if I want, and is very responsive. It comes with a compartment underneath where you install two AAA (not provided) batteries and the tiny USB receiver is also stored there, which you plug into the port on your computer and immediately it starts to work. My laptop is useful again! There is also a switch on the back to turn the keyboard on/off which is helpful, and volume keys at the top of the keyboard, also helpful. You can also turn the trackpad on or off with a switch on the keyboard. I have not used the trackpad much yet because the laptop one still works, but it is great to have that option in case that wears out too. The keyboard is very light, which is nice. I have not tried using it with our smart TV but apparently it will work for that too. The actual keys are compact if you have big hands, making it a little cramped to type, but overall it is a great little keyboard and great seller. Fast shipping and exactly as described. Would definitely recommend the seller and product.

  This is a nice keyboard with an integrated trackpad.

Need two of your own AAA batteries but everything else is included.Very lightweight but seems sturdy enough. Touchpad is accurate and supports touch click and has both left click and right click buttons which is nice.

",$19.99 ,Rii,Gaming,Sam,Good keyboard for the price.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 17, 2016","I recently bought this keyboard and here are my thoughts on it:
Pros:
1. The keys have a really nice sound and feel to them and they aren't too loud.
2. I like that the keys are raised so dirt and hair can't buildup as easily and it makes it easier to blow out and clean.
3. The construction seems nice and solid.
4. It looks really nice and it has an optional pulse light effect settings and brightness settings plus off setting.
5. The edge of the keyboard is lit and it creates a beautiful ambient glow on my desk which is a main reason why I bought this.
6. It doesn't cost much.
7. Good anti ghosting features for gaming and what not.
8. The grips on the bottom are really grippy.
9. It's a pretty keyboard which is good in my book. It stays in place.
10. Silver plated usb and it has decent shielding w/ ring for whatever that matters.

Cons:
1. The brightness isn't too great. I think the max brightness should be at least double what it is. Although it should be adequate for most people, I fear after months or a year of use, the leds will dim and become useless for typing.
2. The lighting isn't even around the edge of the keyboard, for example, specifically the blue leds along the bottom edge are very dim to the human eye compared to the red and purple along the bottom, although taking a picture can't prove this. Plus the top and side edges are nice and bright while the bottom edge is about only half the brightness as the top.
3. The leds for caps lock, num lock, etc are an extremely annoying bright green. These should be a less bright blue or purple to match the keyboard color scheme. Also because of this they didn't add blue or purple leds to the top right edge which is annoying and that takes away from the ambient glow effect this keyboard creates which also means the colors displayed in the pictures on amazon are not correct.
4. The cord is more on the flimsy side but it's not too bad and that doesn't necessarily mean it's of bad quality or weak and that may just be because it's braided. In my experience, braided cords don't last long.
5. The edges are mainly lit with red and blue and some purple with very smal/l hints of other color unlike what they show in the photos.

Conclusion: Overall, for the price I paid (about $22), this is a really solid and nice looking keyboard so I give it 4 stars. I recommend it.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  First, I bought 2 and this applies to both. The feel is like an old style keyboard... and if that's your thing (I was thinking it was for me) that's OK. But, after using modern keyboards and laptops for years...this just feels *old* and not good like I had expected. The keys are nice, but the entire keyboard is too tall to be comfortable. They keys are tall and they are high off your tabletop. The backlighting was a draw too- as my office at night needs backlit keys to be viewable easily. However, the light bleed around the keys themselves is significant which takes away from dimly lit letters... it makes the feature barely work. It's better than no backlight, but not by much.  Also, the keyboard flexes in the middle with little pressure. You can watch it flex as you type. It doesn't not work, but it doesn't make you feel like it's a quality product. Overall there are no major issues to this keyboard, but at the low cost... it is probably a product I will replace and not use... even though both are brand new and work. These purchases were a mixed bag for me. It's left me still looking for a new keyboard...EDIT: The longer I use this, the less I like it... I have decided I really dislike everything about this product. It feels cheap, it flexes and the ergonomics are terrible. It's not worth a replacement and not better than most $9,99 keyboards at your local box store. The LEDs change at random and mean you have to Google how to fix.. which sucks and is time consuming and turning the feature off doesn't help. I have 2 and they both are exactly the same. Would not recommend or buy again.EDIT 2: After really trying to use this for awhile. I finally fixed it. By smashing it to bits. And then breaking it in half. Worst product I have ever bought on Amazon.

  I have given this item, Sparin wireless bluetooth keyboard, a five star rating because it deserves it. When the package arrived, and it was immediately after ordering, I was surprised to see such a significant package. It came in a glossy box with professional imaging and clear verbiage. When I took it out of the box it was perfectly wrapped in a foam envelope which was sealed. Don't you just hate it when the packaging proves that you are not the original purchaser? When I took it out of the envelope I was surprised to feel the weight and then see the shinny aluminum body,. wow!, it looked almost like the one that I got with my 24"" MAC, same exact size and a quick look could cause confusion identifying which was was the expensive on. I bought this item because I just purchased a Samsung 8"" Tablet which came with office. Try typing a document on a tough screen. Half the time I hit the wrong key. This keyboard took two AAA batteries for power and after pushing a small button switch paired immediately. All I had to do was type the code, which appeared on my tablet, on this keyboard and it was connected. No thought or intelligence required. I typed a letter as easily as if I were working on my desk-top system. The only thing that I was missing was a bluetooth mouse to turn my 8"" tablet into a desk-top, and I have since ordered that too. The reason that I configured all this is because I am scheduled to go into the hospital for two surgeries followed by Physical therapy. I will be away at least three weeks and I needs me computer, ha,ha! In conclusion you will not be unhappy with this same purchase if you need or want a wireless keyboard. It just makes life easier, certainly less frustrating, and you can't beat the price. ENJOY!

  Item could be defective.  Who knows?  There aren't any instructions.  I bought this for my son's wii switch.  Although it's not listed as compatible, at least one reviewer said it would work.  It didn't.  I tried it on my PS4, which was listed among the compatible platforms.  It didn't work on that either.  Only the up, down, and esc buttons worked.  None of the buttons on the mouse were recognized by my PS4.  All indicators on the PS4 showed it was connected.  Since there were no instructions, I don't know if I needed to configure it to work (or how to configure it.).  lastly, there was a wildly unhelpful insert included in the box.  It included information about the backlighting, and asked that customers contact them with any issues, but there is no contact information on the insert.  Over all huge disappointment.

HyperX Pudding Keycaps - Double Shot PBT Keycap Set with Translucent Layer, for Mechanical Keyboards, Full 104 Key Set, OEM Profile, English (US) Layout - Black






",$24.99 ,,,J G,"Improvement over last year's keycaps, but still flawed","Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2020","I really enjoy the look of pudding keycaps, and when I saw HyperX updated the typeface fonts to allow circles in font letters, I knew I had to get them. In the old version, it wasn't possible to create circles in characters for the font with that manufacturing process. Letters such as O, A, &, and D had gaps that distracted from the visual look. These new keycaps fixed that issue entirely, and look great visually.

For the font, I would have preferred if they were perhaps 5-10% thinner, as it's crossing the point where the letters look like they have a cheap 'gamer' aesthetic to them.

The reason for the 3/5 stars is because of some quality issues and design choices. As shown in the space bar picture, you can see mold impression markings on the side. All PBT pudding keyboard caps have them to some degree, but in my case they weren't grinded down to be flush and looked rather cheap looking. All the keys in this keycap set have them to a certain degree, the majority of them are small and unnoticeable, but on a few keys, such as Fn and Alt key they are similar to the space bar in the image. The logo on the space bar was also ugly looking and not something I want. Most people buy these keycaps to put in other boards, and the HyperX logo doesn't really fit. They should have just stuck with a standard line like in the previous version. I ended up not using the space bar and stuck with my original instead, which is a shame.

A star off for the spacebar logo choice and slightly thick font, and a star off for the lack of quality control on the mold markings causing them to sometimes protrude on some keys. Other than that, they look visually great once you look past these flaws. I used these on my Anne Pro 2 and they fit perfectly.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  Bought these for my K95 RGB with the understanding that the layouts weren't completely identical. Other than the bottom row (space bar and modifier keys)  everything fits well. These keycaps look amazing and I feel like they were totally worth the money, even taking into account the small incompatibilities.My only issue with these caps is that one of the them (right shift) has markings from the mold ejection pins in the top surface of the key. The sheen is off enough on them that you can tell from the right angle. These marks are by no means obvious, but they are there. Despite the small flaw I'm still very happy with my purchase.

The hyperx pudding keycaps are great for the k6 they feel soft and fit perfectly only with a minor problems. The spacebar gets stuck when you press it softly, I tried to figure out why but I am thinking it might be a problem with the stabilizer on my keyboard ( I don't have that problem with the stock spacebar )

The other problem is not fault of the keypcaps I didn't realize the keychron k6 has a different set of keys that are not standard, if you see the first picture the keys on the right end are too high and look disproportional, I used other keys that have the same shape , it doesn't bother me too much and maybe later I tried to paint them or cover those keys with stickers.

In general the keycaps are great, the rgb looks fantastic and they feel well made. If they can made a version for 68% keyboards like the keychron k6 I think will be perfect.",FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

   Added these to my hyperx alloy elite rgb and they look fantastic!  Can't argue with the results, the LEDs are vivid and bright, and having so much of the lower part of the keycap translucent just makes the whole thing pop.  Gorgeous . I think larger fonts would look a little better on this, definitely improve the contrast, but again can't complain.Only weird thing is that these are ostensibly made for keyboards from hyperx, but instead of getting a second windows key it comes with a function key.  This means my right windows key is wrong.  It's fine, I'm not dying, just weird.  If you buy this same keyboard, but with a 2 after it, it comes with these keycaps pre-installed and also has the correct number of windows keys.  A minor bummer, but whatev.  They look great!

  So I have the Razer Blackwidow Elite (green razer switches) saw other reviews on here that said I could put these bad boys on there except for like, most of the bottom row or some such (Includong spacebar). Well I'm here to tell you that the only keys not usable are the FN and print keys as you see in the photo, the trick is using the tool provided with the keys to detach the brackets from the original space bar, remove the clip wire from the keyboard, then insert one of the brackets into your new space bar and loop the bracket you just put in your new spacebar through the clip wire. Now, without attaching the other bracket to the space bar, loop that on by itself then fasten it to the other end of your spacebar, you want to do this because they sit just maybe a half millimeter wider, now you can reinsert the clip to the keyboard then just push down on the space bar and youre golden💪 Now the keys are beautiful, feels solid. Great material and I only gave 4 stars for brightness but thats really dependent on your keyboard. Love these!

  I didn't expect to like this keyboard.  It's from a brand I didn't know and it was far more basic than other bluetooth keyboards I was looking at.  Significantly, it did not list kindle fire (let alone my kindle fire 5) as a compatible device.Fortunately, it's not only compatible, but works like a charm.  Batteries are not included, but as that is only 2 AAA, that's not a problem.  Setup in my kindle bluetooth options was very easy and was a one time connection process.I really love this keyboard.One hint to anyone buying it:  it works best when you rest it on a hard surface.  though you can type on it from a pillow or bed, you will find yourself typing one handed and inaccurately.this is very lightweight.  Honestly it's perfect for travel.  No need to schlep your laptop with you on holiday unless you need a work-type program like MS Office or Photoshop.  This keyboard lets you use your kindle or your phone for checking and replying to emails with ease when you are away on holiday or just out and about.  I'm also guessing TSA likes the keyboard better than a full laptop when screening for a flight.Really great value.  I would definitely buy this as a gift for someone who loves to travel.Update:  31 August 2020:  About a week ago my keyboard stopped working after I tried to sync it to my TracFone smartphone.  Won't work on either my kindle fire 5 or my phone.  Contacted Sparin and this was their reply: ""Hi Laurel, since our keyboard is special design for Samsung tablets, we are worried that it will be unstable if used on Kindle.""  They are giving me a refund.I still love this keyboard, but if you are considering it for your kindle, do be aware that it might stop working after a few weeks or months.

Price at $13.99 the SPARIN Tablet Bluetooth keyboard for Samsung Galaxy checks the box for affordability.  It also check the boxes for being slim, portable, and compatible with my tablet as well as being easy. I grant it four stars because it fulfills it purpose but that all it does. I like the idea of wireless keyboard but I find that using it with Bluetooth over long periods of time quickly drains my Tab’s battery rather quickly so I am always mindful to keep my charger close  by when using it.  I also find that typing  can be quite loud. Moreover, what would have persuaded me more to give it five stars is if I could use with my Smart TV or at the very least if it had a delete button that allowed you text to the right.

",$25.99 ,,,Doug H.,"Works, but...","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020","
  In my use case, the computer being controlled is typically about 10 feet away across the room (the reason for wireless).  At that distance at least (did not try getting closer because that's not how it's to be used, and hence the middle-of-the-road rating), the keyboard sometime misses characters, sometimes repeats characters.  Usable, but only if you're paying close attention to what the computer is receiving.  The mouse is all but useless.  Moving the mouse pointer across the screen results in the pointer acting like the screen has molasses slowing it down.  It eventually gets there, but only after 1-2 seconds of accelerate/decelerate travel.  Fine control is just about impossible.  Same sluggishness, but on a smaller distance.  You have to move the mouse, wait to see if it hit the right spot on the screen, rinse and repeat, or you'll click on the wrong screen control!  I can NOT use it for my application.  For me it was a waste of money.

",$43.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,Laura,Truly mechanical keyboard at a fraction of the price that delivers the performance one would expect from more expensive brands,"Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2017","
  I have a 2014 Razor Blackwidow Ultimate Stealth keyboard. Granted, it is now pushing close to three years of heavy use and the only sign of wear and is at the point that the braided cord connects at the top of the unit. Also, the passthrough USB functionality has come in handy when two of my USB ports went out on my tower so I was able to easily and quickly get my mouse dialed in. However, I have now purchased the REDRAGON K551 Keyboard on three different occasions as gifts and I am envious every time that I have, as this is an awesome keyboard costing just a fraction of what I'm sure was paid for my keyboard (it too was a gift a few years ago). Fortunately, my most recent Redragon purchases have been for my mom and boyfriend (we live together) so I have had the opportunity to watch him game almost daily on the Redragon and although it is very loud, it is responsive and the 104 key model takes up very little space. Another high point for me is that it is lightweight. I game with my keyboard in my lap and have dropped this beast of a Razor keyboard on my toes too many times to count. The Redragon is still solid though and the cord is so much more flexible. I really do not care for how bulky my cords are compared to these. Also, the Redragon does offer a rainbow back-lighting option although I went w/ just the red for both previous purchases. My boyfriend and I also have past experience with Corsair and came away feeling as though they just weren't as comfortable or responsive. I do not know the exact actuation of the Redragon other than that it is short which to me equals good. I gave my boyfriend's brother a Redragon almost three years ago as well and it still looks and works like it is brand new and believe me, these guys (they're twins) are harder on stuff than anyone I have ever met so it passes their abuse, I think it's safe to say these are built well at an affordable price. I understand my review isn't all that technical but do hope it is helpful in some small manner - at the very least hopefully it will reinforce the fact that you made a great purchasing decision. Happy computing to all!

PROS:
+Sturdy metal build, high quality feel
+LED is beautiful, has breathing / brightness options
+Has 10-key
+Low price

CONS:
-Very loud, switches are more like green
-KEY CHATTER - many people reported this same issue; after a bit, certain keys started to register multiple times with one key stroke or not register at all (like the A key, while gaming. Kind of important...) I bought some quick dry electronics contact cleaner and sprayed it in the switch and it's working correctly again, so the problem must be related to some dust / dirtiness in the switches. Since so many people have the same problem, I'm thinking there's some issue with their factory / assembly. Needs to be addressed.

  EDIT, see original 5 star review below: Worked a year and a day. And then, it gave up the ghost. In the middle of a ranked game. With no other computer issues present. A section of the keyboard just died. I thought that I had a glitch on my hands, and restarted, but to no avail. I actually ended up pulling out the Blackwidow this keyboard replaced and plugged it in and completed my game. I wish I could say that I won, but life doesn't always have happy endings.ORIGINAL: I bought this to replace a very expensive Razer Blackwidow. One of the older ones, from before Razer switched away from using cherry mx switches and tried to sell it as a good thing.  ANYWAYS, my keyboard had a drinking problem. I will give them their due, Razer made a peripheral that can really hold it's gin and tonics. But every morning that I woke up to find that some irresponsible jerk (drunk me) had spilled another drink in the keyboard and gone to sleep without even trying to clean up, 1 or 2 keys never came back to life. 4 spills later and I had a mostly functional keyboard.I thought this thing was going to be a huge step down in quality, but I have to say, it seems to be very well constructed and I am loving it. This one is on a strict diet though, no alcoholic drinks allowed.

",$23.99 ,,,neurodoc,Functional but not very enjoyable to use,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2020","The mouse shuts off after a relatively short time of disuse and requires that you click one of its buttons to reactivate.

Otherwise the mouse is fine.

The keyboard also has some problems. The keys require a firm deep press to register and the keyboard feels somewhat unpleasant to type on because of the way the keys move when pressed. The raised areas on the f and j keys, used to identify those keys for touch typists, are very low and barely detectable.

Logitech Illuminated Ultrathin Keyboard K740 with Laser-Etched Backlit Keyboard and Soft-Touch Palm Rest - Black






",$59.99 ,Logitech,,Alastair G. Stell,WAS the best wired keyboard in Logitech repertoire (past tense),"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2017","Keyboards are highly individual-preference items but for me this is head-and-shoulders the best keyboard from Logitech in terms of tactile sensation. Key presses provide positive feedback with a travel distance of about 2mm. Key pressure is moderate which ensures decent tactile feedback.

Other considerations. The keyboard is indeed very slim, elegant and the white back-light is even across the keyboard. Not super bright but appropriate to our office environment. I have no need of an illuminated keyboard - unfortunately Logitech does not (appear to) make a comparable keyboard without the back-light.

-------------

Since first writing this review (yesterday), 3 of the keys have become skewed or have fallen off entirely. The CTRL key isn't working properly.

I read in one of the earlier reviews that quality has suffered. Unfortunately I can confirm this observation. Looking at the keyboard several of the keys are lop-sided and probable candidates for falling off or jamming. I have not seen this issue on the previous 7 keyboards (all K740) so I have to guess that Logitech have changed something about the manufacture or assembly of these keyboards. Only Logitech can answer that question!

Anyhow, for an expensive keyboard this should not be happening. As a result I've taken 3 stars off the review. Logitech, whatever you've done in respect of manufacture, you need to rethink.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  I love Logitech.  They stand behind their products.  I wouldn't buy anything else, Logitech has made me a loyal customer.I bought this keyboard for the backlighting.  I'm on my second keyboard (warranty) because the keys are very fragile.This is a scissor switch keyboard.  Scissor switches were common in older laptops.  Most of those hold up fairly well but this setup does not.  The keys begin to crunch and will not depress normally at times as if something is stuck under them.  I've tried compressed air to clear it but there were no foreign objects.  I had three keys not functioning (left shift, #6 on the numpad, and space).  It was going back for warranty so I decided to see if I could fix the keys before calling it in.I work in IT.  In older laptops you could remove the key, clear the object or fix the scissor.  I could not with this keyboard.  There was no way to reassemble the scissor once the key is pulled off.  What I did learn was that there were no foreign objects as I had suspected.  The switches are just that bad.If it weren't for the bad switches this would be a rock star keyboard.  It's thin, quiet, and the backlighting is very helpful for my situation.You could still take you chances because Logitech will stand behind this if you run into a problem.Sorry Logitech, I've never given you a one-star review.

  A straightforward, elegantly-designed, rectangular and wired keyboard with backlit keys so you can see what the computer buttons are that you want to depress when you're typing in a darkened room. I decided I wanted a wired keyboard -- since wireless keyboards are more fragile in comparison, and, wireless keyboards that have backlit keys will drain their rechargeable or removable batteries much too quickly.  Thus, I settled for a wired one that's, ""low maintenance.""  And if you're looking for a keyboard with multiple colors and wild housing designs to appeal to the eyes and minds of gamers from ages 10 to 17, this isn't the keyboard for you.  All the alphanumerics are backlit with white L.E.D.s. -- looks more professional, more elegant (and in my opinion, it's more appealing to practical-minded adults) to keep the color scheme limited and consistent for its backlit design. The alphanumerics themselves are laser-etched for a precision appearance. All the keys have a shallow depth and a responsive, light touch with a near-muted, click-tactile feedback for ergonomic finger strikes; they're part and parcel to its overall low profile. Like a lot of electrically-powered backlit keyboards -- don't get it wet -- otherwise, keys simply won't respond for shorting it out. (If this keyboard was waterproof I would have rated it with the full five stars). Function keys on the top row are either software-programmable, or they have preset functions enabled via the same software.  Even if you didn't use the keyboard's software that comes with it, Windows recognizes it as a standard keyboard device anyway, and it starts working as soon as you plug it into any viable USB port. A nice, clean, fast feature are its manual adjustments for key brightness and sound volume, and these four keys are located in one row in the upper right corner. After I wore out the first keyboard after using it for several years (I shorted out the backlighting of a few keys for accidentally spilling drinks on it over the years), I decided that this keyboard was good enough for me to purchase this exact same model, again ...and I did just that.

I use the AnnePro 2 at home, the Keychron at work and the ducky One 2 mini to play online. For all-around tasks, the most versatile is by far the Anne Pro 2.

Connectivity.
I can pair it with my iPhone Ipad and Mac via Bluetooth and switch seamlessly between the 3 devices (even while the USB is connected to the keyboard.) something the keychron k2 cannot do.)

Aesthetics and Build Quality.

The keyboard is well built, sturdy and premium, and if you want to travel it isn't extremely heavy.
Both my other keyboards are black so I went for the white version of the AP2 and IT IS GORGEOUS! I was a bit skeptical before I ordered it but when it arrived I was delighted, and still am!
The only main issue I found is that you cannot modify the angle, so you are basically stuck with the angle the keyboard comes with. I got used to it because basically it is exactly the same angle as my Ducky On 2 mini. There are not little feet below the keyboard.
All the keycaps are white but it comes with some custom color keycaps which I like to use (Pic related). I really like the ""lego"" look of those keycaps.

RGB is bright fully customizable and has plenty of effects. I am not a fan of effects and use colors for key purposes basically so I can't give you a review of effects, sorry for that.

Software.
Another great thing about this keyboard is the software, so no need to memorize Keystrokes in order to create macros, change the layout to PC or Mac, Customize RBG colors, you can do everything from the software (Available for Mac PC, and Linux), even update the Firmware.

TAP feature
For those getting a 60% keyboard, you will notice there are no arrows on that keyboards, BUT the AP2 has a TAP layer feature which lets you use the right shift and keys below as arrows when you press them once.
IT is great for people getting used to the 60% layout. Take into account that if you want to SHIFT select text or other key combination, the TAP feature is useless, you will have to FN WASD and SHIFT at the same time. It takes a bit to get used to it, but after a while, the TAP function helps you transition.

The PCB isn't quite as good as an authentic Vortex or the CODE keyboard. Specifically, there's trouble with using the Function keys back to back. If you cmd+fn1+tab, you can't cmd+1 or something like that without releasing the fn1 key. It's kind of annoying if you've used one of the better keyboards before, which allow you to do that.

RBG lighting looks good, but the programming interface is really buggy. I can't seem to program the lighting, I get error messages that don't make any sense.

Overall it's pretty good quality. It's a straight clone of another keyboard, so you might want to buy the Vortex if you care about such things.",TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  This is is a really cute keyboard and the keys depress perfectly to my liking. They aren't exceptionally loud or thick, but enough that it satisfies the quirky mechanical keyboarding ASMR thing that relaxes me. The only downside to this keyboard is that it works with Mac computers BUT requires a small USB plugged into a standard USB port to work. If you have a 2020 MacBook Air like me, you know there are no USB ports so you have to have an adapter. That, in addition to this keyboard requiring a USB to work isn't terrible, but I imagine it will be somewhat annoying when schools open back up and I have to remember to pack the extra stuff in my bag for this to function. I will most likely spring for a similar keyboard with bluetooth capability for that purpose. For a home setup, however, this is perfectly fine and works like a charm. I have no comments about the included mouse as I had already purchased a different one that I love so there is no need for another one. It's good to know I have a backup though just in case. I also cannot comment on the battery life since I have only had it for a few hours. In the small amount of time I have had it and used it,  this is a great little keyboard and I hope it continues to function well over an extended period of time. I will come back and update my review if anything changes.

  I didn’t notice the q&a regarding a lack of on/off switch on the keyboard or I wouldn’t have bought this set but that’s on me. However the manual shows an on/off switch for the mouse that does not exist. I am concerned about constant battery drain or having to take out the batteries every night when I’m done and putting them back every morning to keep from going through a ton of batteries. It’s definitely a drawback. I will see how battery life lasts and may increase rating if it isn’t a problem.Aesthetically the keyboard is adorable and comfortable even with my joint issues. The mouse is very comfortable for me. It’s larger than I’m used to but suits my hand well. Other than the possible battery drain and lack of ability to turn them on or off I do like. I will update this later.

For some reason I thought these were RGB.. they are not.  They are rainbow LED.  Also most of the FN keys are different that the white edition, the keys even sounded different.. and there were a few other differences as well.  I just wasn't that impressed with this keyboard and returned with no issues.  The company that sold it was very helpful and quick with my return.  Would buy from them again.

  LOVE IT! The E-Element Z-88 Rainbow LED Backlit Water-Proof mechanical keyboard is exactly what I was looking for. I did a lot of searches and I did not want one with a numbers pad so it wouldn't take up so much space on my desk.  My previous keyboard was so large that when I went to type at length, I had to center the keyboard to my hands but then my mouse was FAR to the right which with any length of time was just uncomfortable. I hated it. This keyboard is compact and easily fits center to my hands with plenty of room for my mouse. But the best thing is the click of typing as it coordinates with my brain so that my typing is so much faster with less mistakes. It's not too loud.  It's plug and play. I highly recommend this keyboard for anyone that has the same needs as I did. The price is reasonable too.

  I originally had a full size keyboard that caused my mouse to bump into the side of the number pad constantly. The reason being because I like to have the keyboard at a lower degree angle pointing downwards to my right hand side. This play method would force me to move the keyboard further away from my mouse, which resulted in discomfort and often times wrist pain; however, since I've purchased this keyboard to do away with the number pad - I'm overjoyed. The play experience has increased ten fold and I am able to play comfortably without any concern of over stretching my arm, wrist, or having the mouse hit the side of the keyboard when trying to perform 180 degree turns with my DPI set at 400 or 800 (depending on the game). Def worth the price for what this keyboard offers.The only flaw this keyboard has, IMO, is that the red switches do no not perform well b/c they're extremely sensitive. I've noticed that the red switches are not finely tuned b/c I've see where I'll try to move left, but for some reason my character wants to go forward or has this late effect when inputting the key. I've had brown switches laying around and decided to swap them out, which has since solved the issue. Go for either blue or brown switches because the reds just don't feel right or faulty from what I've experienced.

",$38.99 ,HUO JI,Gaming,B H,Small Size Helps Keep Mouse Arm in More Ergonomic & Comfortable Position,"Reviewed in the United States on August 25, 2020","KEYS:
Pro:
I purchased the quietest, red switchess. They are about as quiet as my old, cheap Logitech keys.
Con:
However, they are also rather squishy and I find that the weight of my fingers alone while resting is enough to register a keypress without tactile feedback. I was still able to achieve almost 100 WPM using an online typing test, but the error rate was higher than normal. I will be returning the red switches in favor of the brown ones.

FORM FACTOR:
As the headline says, the small size helps keep my mouse arm in a more ergonomic and comfortable position - especially compared to my old Logitech keyboard w/ numpad. Check out the attached picture for the size comparison!!

I was a bit worried about the ""60%"" size, but as mentioned above, I can type comfortably and achieve my usual 100WPM. I measured the keys, and they are 1/2"" wide and 9/16"" tall - the same as my standard size keyboard.

QUALITY:
This model uses a USB-C connector for the keyboard side of the cable and USB-A connector for the PC side of the cable. USB-C is meant to be plugged in any orientation, but unfortunately, my keyboard did not work when the USB-C cable was plugged in opposite of how it was plugged in at the factory. Minus 1-star for that. I'll rarely unplug it so it won't bother me, but I can see how it would bother people who might travel with this board.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

It's exactly what I expected and wanted,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2015","I'm about half-way through reading this book; I've had it for 3 days now, and it's 340 pages, so that should tell you something; I've been plowing through it pretty aggressively. It's exactly what I expected and wanted, with the bonus that it's pretty well-written.

I'm researching in preparation for buying my 1st keyboard, and I wanted a book that would explain to me all the various types of modern electronic keyboards, the common features, and explain the jargon, so I could understand the differences, and shop with an informed eye - even though I'm a complete beginner.

While I didn't buy it as a music-instruction book, it has about 50 pages of 'how-to-play' instructional material in it, and I expect to take advantage of that (in addition to other books and YouTube videos) to teach myself to play, when I complete my shopping/purchase adventure.

A major plus are the links to sound-snippets online, which the author uses to demonstrate the sounds of the various instruments, and the various effects that can be applied to the sounds. In the sound-files, he typically explains what he's about to play, and then plays it, so you can clearly identify the sound/effect/feature he's illustrating. There are also sound-files for the musical exercises presented in the 'how-to' section.

You can change the color patterns and DPI with buttons on it. It works right out of the box. The Keyboard is the lesser of the kit. It works, the keys are akin to mechanical buttons and its fairly loud (some like this, I do), but they're wiggly and not solid, so it feels cheap. The keys are not backlit (a shame...). The RGB is nice, not super bright, but nice enough for what is basically a $10 keyboard, no patterns, no flashing, no changing of color, just on/off basically. But again, its ok for $10.

Wireless Keyboard and Mouse, Jelly Comb 2.4G Wireless Keyboard Mouse Full Size with 12 Multi-Media Keys and Auto Sleep for Windows/Computer/PC/Laptop/Desktop-Black






",$24.99 ,,,Katie Nguyen,Very quiet and easy to use,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2020","
  This is now my favorite combo package, the Jelly Comb 2.4G has a quiet keyboard and mouse. The reason I am switching from the mechanical keyboard to this keyboard is that because my partner had always complained about the ""annoying"" noise from the mechanical keyboard, especially at night; so the problem is now solved with this new keyboard. The feeling is very good with its pleasingly clickable keys, and very comfortable. Another good point is its simple design, so it is very easily operated even though for anyone who has limited knowledge of computer, as simple as plug-n-play. It came with 12 multi-media keys, they are very useful while I am watching movies in full screen or web browsing. For a lazy person like me, it has the auto-sleep function to save the battery; and the keyboard and mouse are powered by 2 batteries on each device, so the manufacturer advertised that this combo could be good for at least 1 year without replacing new batteries in. The price is ok, not too bad; but it would be better if the price is 10% lower than actual.

Rii Bluetooth 4.0 Wireless Multiple Color Rainbow LED Backlit Keyboard With Rechargeable Battery For iOS Android and Windows Tablet PC Laptop Notebook MacBook






",$17.99 ,Rii,,Andrea Acailawen,"Keyboard connects easily, but the battery life is poor and keystrokes aren’t always detected","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2019","I bought this keyboard to use with the iPad Pro, since the Apple Smart Folio Keyboard can only be used with the tablet in landscape orientation and it isn’t usable while drawing. My feelings on this keyboard are mixed.

The good:
This keyboard connects very easily via Bluetooth to my iPad Pro, iPad Mini 5 and smartphone. There is no multi-device function on this keyboard, but at this price, I wouldn’t expect one. Switching from one device to another is simple enough though. Simply turn off bluetooth on the current device, enable it on the device you want to use, then pair it when it comes up in the bluetooth device list. It’s a few extra steps, but not too time consuming. It’s also easy to use, comfortable to type on and all of the keys function smoothly.

The bad:
The keyboard periodically fails to register keystrokes on the iPad Pro or letters disappear immediately after typing. I am guessing that there are brief hiccups in the bluetooth connection that causes this. It’s intermittent and seems to happen more as the battery gets weaker. Which brings me to...

The Ugly:
The battery life with this keyboard is poor. At best, I get 3-4 days out of a set of rechargeable AAA batteries before having to swap them. This is with turning off the keyboard whenever it isn’t in use. When the batteries get low, there is no warning, either. The keyboard just suddenly stops working and the iPad’s built in keyboard pops up on the screen. I then have to swap out the pair and wait for the iPad to detect that connection again. This is frustrating, especially since it usually happens mid-sentence.

Other:
I did try connecting this keyboard via Wi-Fi to a couple of devices that should have been compatible, but was unable to get it to work.

That’s pretty much it in a nutshell. The keyboard is simple to connect and use via Bluetooth, but there are some quirks, questionable Wi-Fi and the battery life is poor. It’s nowhere near the long life that is promised. I wouldn’t buy this keyboard again, but also don’t know that it’s worth the hassle to send back.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

That alone isn't worth a bad review though, most keyboards come that way I think. The mouse is cool but I'm actually not sure if I'm going to keep this one here, it might be a little complicated for the kids with all the extra buttons, they'll just be doing simple computer stuff. I'm sure it's great for gaming with all these buttons. We're going to at least give it a try before I decide to switch or not.

Foldable Bluetooth Keyboard with Touchpad - Samsers Portable Wireless Keyboard with Stand Holder, Rechargeable Full Size Ultra Slim Pocket Folding Keyboard for Android Windows IOS Tablet & Laptop-Gray






",,Samsers,,B. Pearce,Not bad at all...  Pleasantly surprised!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2019","
  I bought this keyboard to use with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8...  I'm one of those crazy people who still mourn the loss of slide out qwerty keyboards on smart phones and I use my phone to send e-mails at work quite a lot, so this was definitely needed.  I am a bit obsessed with keyboards (I love clicky mechanical keyboards and have Unicomp Model M clone as my daily driver at home)... I touch type 92 words per minute, so having a real keyboard is very important to me as I can't stand typing on glass.  I've had this one for about a week now, and it works better than many other Bluetooth keyboards that I've tried in the past.  Many of them miss characters, or enter characters multiple times when you only strike them once, but this one does not do that.  Another problem that is common among Bluetooth keyboards, but not this on this one is that many of them have some of the keys (shift, or backspace, for example) oddly shaped and sized, which is not fun when you are a touch typist.  With this keyboard, there were no surprises, the layout is standard and I have been able to find every key without a huge learning curve. I love that it came with the stand, the stand it worth more than its weight in gold...  it holds the phone at the pefect angle and the rubber feet on the bottom really work well to prevent it from sliding around.  The keyboard also arrived fully charged, so I was able to begin playing with it immediately, I didn't have to charge it for a long time before I could use it.  It paired easily, both with my Surface Pro 3 (Windows device) and with my Galaxy Note 8 (Android).  I'm sure Apple people would have similar results, though I can't speak from experience.  I had been hoping to buy a Waytools Textblade, but since those things were supposed to ship in 2015 and they still haven't entered mass production, I Iost hope and had to search for an alternative...  I'm glad that I found th is one!  To turn it on, you simply unfold it, to turn it off, you fold it closed, so there is no power switch..  I've been typing like crazy on it for a week and it still hasn't needed a charge!  If I had to pick something to complain about, I would say that they only give you a USB cord to charge it with...  the USB cord is very short (about 15 inches long), and I'd prefer it to come with something that I can plug into a wall.  I can use my cell phone charger if I ever need to, but I haven't had to charge it yet.  It would also be nice if a light a was included for caps lock.  Also, when I am editing documents, I use delete and backspace pretty equally... with this keyboard, they are the same key, you have to hold the function button down and press the backspace key to get ""delete"".  That is a slight annoyance, but I can learn to live with it.  One other thing to note is that the keyboard does not lock closed, there is a magnet that does a decent job of keeping it shut when not in use, but if you need something stronger than that, this may not be the keyboard for you.  Another thing to be aware of is that the keys are not backlit... I do not care about this as a touch typist, but hunt and peck people would have a hard time with this keyboard in a dark room.  The final thing that annoys me about keyboard is that it can't remember more than 1 device at a time, so if you switch devices, you will have to re-pair it every time.  I switch between my Galaxy Note 8 and Surface Pro 3 frequently, so that is slightly annoying, but it does pair easily.  The good far outweighs the bad here.  I'd say to give it a try, it works better than many of the other options available and the price does not break the bank!

  This keyboard replaced one that was similar in size. I like this one more. The faux leather keeps the keyboard stable and not make noise when I type on it on my glass table.

",$49.99 ,HUO JI,Gaming,Mitch W.,"we have been seeing a good deal of keyboards popping up listed as ""mechanical"" keyboards","Reviewed in the United States on September 21, 2016","
  Ever since Cherry's patent on mechanical switches expired, we have been seeing a good deal of keyboards popping up listed as ""mechanical"" keyboards.  These are typically cheaper because they used clone copies of Cherry's original design which makes manufacturing cheaper and in turn, the price of the product cheaper.  These clone switches usually have lower quality specs and standards than Cherrys, but are still good switches.  The most common are: Kaihl (Kaihl also produces Razer's green and yellow switches), Gateron, Greetech, and Otemu.  E-Element uses Otemu switches in this keyboard.Please note: although this keyboard is listed as a RGB LED keyboard, you do not have the customization that you see in higher tier keyboards.  You cannot pick a custom color.  The LEDs are restricted to: red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, a pinkish purple, and white.When typing on this keyboard next to my Razer Blackwidow Ultimate (older version that uses Cherry MX Blue switches) there is a slightly noticeable feel between the switches, but you have to be feeling for it.  The Z-88 is much louder than the Blackwidow.  Due to the slight difference in feel, I do prefer the original Cherry MX Blues in the Blackwidow compared to the Otemu switches in the Z-88, but I have been using MX Blues for over ten years, I'm going to feel a difference, so your mileage may very.  However, when paired with 0.2mm o-rings, I prefer the feel and sound of the Z-88 over the Blackwidow.  The sound and response of the keyboard is cleaner and nicer to use.Physically, the keyboard is very sturdy with very little flex.  This is due to the metal backplate under the keycaps.  The bottom of the keyboard has four rubber pads and the end of the feet also have rubber pads to reduce movement on the keyboard.  E-Element has included cable routing channels on the underside of the keyboard so the cable may exit on either side or out of the middle at the back of the keyboard.The keycaps are double-shot injected molds.  The outside being black with laser etching and obviously the inside being a translucent white.  The fonts on the keycaps are ok, but they're not my favorite.  I've replaced the letters and number caps with the caps from a Logitech G710+ I had laying in my closet.The RGB LED lighting is decent.  If you're used to using a Logitech, Razer, Cooler Master, Ducky, etc; the brightness of the LEDs will disappoint you.  The max brightness is about half the max brightness on my G710+ and Blackwidow.  It's fine though to be honest.  I've never used max brightness on my Blackwidow or G710+.There are 10 color modes for this keyboard.  They are:-Unison color across the whole keyboard-Breathing-Gaming mode which only lights up WASD, the arrow keys, and your escape key.-Color Spectrum.  The LEDs gradually change through the color spectrum.-Single key lighting.  The key that you strike momentarily lights up.-Wave.  The brightness across the keyboard alternates creating a wave affect.-""Snake"" mode.  The LEDs start at escape and one by one light up across the keyboard and then cycle back.-Ripple.  After striking a key, a ripple affect is created by the LEDs.-Surround. The keys immediately surrounding the key struck is momentarily lit up.-Off.  Derp mode.These lighting modes can be cycled through by hitting FN+PgDn.The different lighting modes have different colors to them and different speeds.The brightness of the LEDs can be adjusted by hitting FN+Up Arrow and FN+Down ArrowThe speed of the animations can be changed by hitting FN+Left Arrow and FN+Right ArrowYou cycle through the colors by hitting FN+""="" and FN+""-""There are various multimedia keys and a windows lock key that can also be used with FN as well.I personally brought this keyboard because I wanted a mechanical 60% keyboard with backlighting.  I didn't want to spend $130 on a RGB Pok3r only to find out that I didn't like 60% keyboards.  However, I do like the format and I do like this keyboard.  I'll will be using this for my daily driver from here on out.

",$49.99 ,HUO JI,Gaming,AnotherAmazonReviewer,Get this over the black version. Great entry mechanical keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2017"," If you're on this product page, you have most likely seen the more popular black version with more reviews. Well, I'm here to tell you that this is the better buy between the two and I'll tell you why. Unlike the black colored variant that most people are buying, this comes with additional Outemu Blue switches and a keyswitch puller.

This keyboard features Outemu Blue switches, which are Cherry MX clones. However, I've noticed these switches are not the same as other Outemu Blues I've seen on other keyboards. They feel a bit scratchy, but you can put in any switch you want if you don't like them (more on this later). They have some studs around the little cross, but this doesn't seem to have any purpose. If you want to get custom keycaps, they should work, but with one issue. The right shift key is an unusual size, making it hard to find a compatible keycaps set. Your best bet is to either find a white keycap set so that the shift key doesn't stand out too much or find some way to create your own keycap for that right shift.

The main reason why I recommend this keyboard is because it features hot-swappable keyswitches. With the included keyswitch puller, you can pull out the switches and put in a different MX style switch and it'll work, no soldering needed. Why would you want such a feature? One reason is that this eliminates one point of failure. If a keyswitch stop working, just take it out (they do include 5 spare switches). Or if you want to try a different switch but don't want to spend $40+ on another keyboard, you can buy a bag of switches for as low as $30 (price depends on the manufacturer of the switch). One thing to keep in mind is that the holes for the pin on the switches are smaller than standard cherry pins, so you will need to file down the pins on your switches before installing them.

Let's talk about the design of the keyboard. The keyboard uses a detachable micro-USB cable. This means you can get a new cable if the stock cable breaks or get a nicer cable. The cable that comes in the box is a pretty stand thick gray cable with no-frills. There are 3 channels for the cable to go through, the sides and straight out the back. One thing the white version of this keyboard has over the black variant is that the LED appears to be much brighter and more vivid. This is because the backplate reflects the lights much better than a black surface does. This creates a nice under-glow and more even lighting compared to the black version. The backplate appears to be a solid piece of aluminum, which makes the keyboard feel very sturdy and a more premium. The housing appears to be PBT plastic, but I can't tell for sure since it doesn't have any indicator. As for the keycaps, it has that really awful gamer font that many budget mechanical keyboard uses. They're doubleshot ABS, not laser-etched as the product description states, which is good. This means that the legends will not fade away, but because they are abs this means they are prone to shining. With my black Z-88, the spacebar already has a bit of wear on the right side after 3 weeks of use.

The lighting effects are pretty good for the price. It's not a ""true"" RGB keyboard as it only has a small number of colors to choose from. However, with these colors, I am sure you'll find one that matches your setup. I was surprised to see that the white color mode is actually pretty white compared to other RGB keyboards where the white would be a blue or a bit pink. There are 10 lighting modes to choose from, I have uploaded a video showing these.

Overall this is a great keyboard for those who are looking at getting a mechanical keyboard but don't want to spend a lot of money to find a good one.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  As the other review said, get this over the black version. If you had multiple keyboards in the past, they probably were black keyboards. So I would advise you to try this keyboard out, as it is something new and refreshing to look at (not racist, all keys matter right?). The translucent property of the individual keys allows the glow of the LEDs to just flare, which you can't help but marvel at every time, especially in the dark.

",,Keychron,Gaming,Robert,Some bad and some good...,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019","First off let me say the height of this keyboard is a lot higher then any other i have tried, making it mandatory to use a wrist rest with this keyboard unless you want to destroy your wrist. I have been using it for the past 3 days and have already began to notice my left wrist hurting and being agitated. I don't like to use wrist rests and for this reason and others below i am going to return it.

*Keycaps
Other then the height of the keyboard the keycaps are extremely low quality and cheap. Maybe someone that has not used high quality keycaps could be okay with it but the ones that come on the board are so thin that you can flex them without much force when you take them off. Even comparing them to keyboards that are half the cost they are extremely thin, i would honestly say they are the thinnest i have ever used. They make the gateron brown switches in them feel heavier to press down then they should feel. As soon as i got it i replaced the keycaps.

*Switches
The switches feel fine, just like any other gateron brown switch smooth and tactile. However the sound of them are fine for the most part but sometimes you can hear a pinging sound (like spring reverberation) I believe its not the switches and rather the keyboard housing being more hollow, not too big of a deal but it does have that sound rarely.

*keyboard build
The keyboard build feels average, its not too light but it's not as solid as other keyboards in this price range. I believe most of the problems arise from this being a wireless board at this price range, they had to cut costs and it shows mostly in the keycaps and the keyboard housing being more hollow. Note that it does not feel hollow when handled but the sound of pinging that shows up sometimes when typing fast and hard along with a picture i have seen from another review shows that it has more open space inside of the case then other keyboards.

*Stabilizers, rgb etc.
The stabs for me are actually nice, they come pre lubed and i know for sure the spacebar stab is clipped and it makes a nice satisfying *thack* sound when bottomed out. The stabs for enter,backspace and shift feel nice and smooth. The rgb options are your standard options with this kind of board and have brightness controls but DOES NOT have speed controls for how fast the effect is.

Overall i would not suggest this keyboard for this price range unless you need to have a wireless keyboard, and even then there are better options for just $20-$30 more and i would highly suggest those options as they have very good dye sub pbt keycaps and are built better.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I LOVE this keyboard. The clicky sounds are perfect. I am a grad student and don't know squat about keyboards, but I am studying for comprehensive exams where everyone is in a room and typing loudly. This will definitely condition me to the noise. LOL. Generally, I feel like I type more productively using this board. If you are someone that loves clicking sound of the old school keyboard, you will like this. I gave it 4 stars because the battery life isn't as long as I would like (I can't tell you the norm is though). I don't like that the charging port for the board is on the side. I would prefer it to be in the back. I don't have a lot of desk space so it gets in the way. It lights up which is great for late-night typing. At $87 I found the board to be pricey for me yet the features influenced my choice. I do a lot of writing so time will tell but so far so good. Oh...if you are used to laptop keyboard this will be an adjustment. Make sure to purchase a wristguard as this board sits an inch or so higher.

",,Keychron,Gaming,Amazon Customer,"Affordable, feature-packed keyboard","Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2019","What's not to love about this keyboard? It's phenomenal!

Gateron Brown linear switches. They're not ""clicky"" and they provide a light tactile bump. But they're not mushy like a membrane keyboard. The actuation point for the keys is very close to the top of the keystroke, meaning that you don't have to push the keys all the way down. This reduces finger fatigue and increases typing speed at the same time. My other mechanical keyboard has cherry blues - tactile and clicky - which some people love but I do not.

3-channel bluetooth connectivity with on-the-fly switching and a three-week battery. That's right, it's wireless and you can switch between devices. It supports mac, windows, ios, and android, so you can type messages on your phone. And not only that, it stays alive forever.

Features. This keyboard comes packed with features. Screen brightness adjustment, window switching and management, keyboard backlight adjustment, media and volume controls, dedicated screenshot button, all in a compact form. Someone was complaining about it missing an ""insert"" key on another review - I don't miss accidentally writing over my work. Arrow keys come included. Document navigation keys like page up/down, home and end, which other compact wireless mechanical keyboards do not have.

Backlit RGB options. This keyboard lights up pretty with multiple settings. This is more for fun, but it does have a solid backlight color option.

Tiny. This thing is compact which means it's travel-ready. It's got less width than my 15.6"" laptop. It hardly weighs anything. It's wireless (3 weeks!) with a rechargeable battery.

Price point. This thing is $90. You can find less expensive keyboards, but they don't have nearly the functionality of this one. This one is designed with programming, office work, and gaming in mind.

Personal preference: I might miss having a number pad because I periodically type a lot of numbers. But being wireless and travel-ready more than makes up for that. Additionally some people may complain about key wobble and thin key caps. I haven’t found either of these issues to affect my work. For a portable keyboard these problems are excusable.

I am highly satisfied with this product. I haven't had it long enough to experience any defects, and if I do I'll update this review. Future improvement: custom rubber-coated gaming keycaps.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",,,,David,"Good Quality, watch the ""delete"" button","Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2020","
  Purchased to replace a Logitech MK360 compact keyboard/mouse combo.  My job requires being on the computer basically all day, and I take online classes at night so my keyboard & mouse see a lot of use.  This set seems well built, very compact for full-size island-style keys with a full number pad.  The keyboard is very quiet and the mouse is almost silent.  The mouse is comfortable to use and seems to work on most surfaces, and the DPI switch is handy for quickly adjusting cursor speed without having to go into the settings.  The keyboard's arrow keys are a little better defined & spreadsheet friendly than other compact keyboards I looked at.  So far I haven't noted any lag (see note on sleep feature below).  My main gripe is that the ""delete"" and ""backspace"" keys are right next to each other as opposed to the delete being above, which is the location on both the K360 and my laptop keyboard, so I often find myself hitting delete instead of backspace.  The backspace key itself is also a little smaller than the other two keyboards mentioned, which makes the problem worse.  I would gladly deal with a few mm extra width to separate the column of keys with delete/home etc. just a bit more from the main keyboard.  Other than that, this is a solidly built set & comfortable to use.  Time will tell if it holds up.One other note:  the sleep feature on the keyboard & mouse saves battery, but you have to hit a key to wake up the keyboard (or a mouse button to wake that up) so if you have left it alone for a while watch the first word you type.

",,,,Park,Solid keyboard and mouse that works for Macbook Pro!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020","
  I was looking for a simple keyboard and mouse pair that would work with my macbook pro. The other brands on Amazon were more expensive, had bad reviews about the mouse, flex in the keyboard, and had a rechargeable battery instead of AA. I also did not like the other keyboard's aesthetics, mostly color combinations of white and silver paint. This keyboard was the best at the most reasonable price.The keyboard has a nice matte texture to the keys that makes it very comfortable to type on. I personally dislike when keys get slick and oily, so this was a nice plus. The all black also looks really clean. The best quality would be the rubber lining on the back. This prevents the keyboard from moving around or sliding on the table. I have a slippery glass table so this is probably the feature I like the most. The only thing that could be better is the angle of the keyboard. it is clearly stated in the product description, so I knew what I was getting. But after typing on it for a week, I missed having the option of having the keyboard completely flat. The angle is quite small anyway, but the option would be nice. There is no flex to the keyboard, solidly built, keys are very quiet, no lag with my macbook pro, and very easy to set up. I prefer the AA batteries because its more convenient for me--i find that a rechargeable battery is more frequent in wireless keyboards. Also, the mouse is pretty good--sometimes the mouse in these pairs are of poor quality, but this mouse is well built, no lag, and has a solid click. I wanted an attractive black keyboard and mouse that was solidly built and worked with macOS and am very satisfied with this keyboard purchase. I would definitely recommend it to someone who wanted a stable keyboard for their computer.

",$31.99 ,,,Jerry Hanel,Good keyboard for travel!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2020","As an author, I tend to write thoughts and ideas on the go. I have this keyboard tucked away in my car so that when I am out and about I can pull out my tablet and keep writing, even in the car.

KEYBOARD
My tablet had a few issues connecting to it the first time. I think there may be a timing issue between presenting the user with the code to type and the pairing once you hit enter. However, once I got past this, everything was exactly as expected. This was marketed toward a Mac user, so I wasn't at all surprised to see the apple-command key and the ""option"" key. I'm not a mac user, but was pleasantly surprise that it would ""rearrange"" keyboard layout for Android and Windows (specifically the ""backspace"" and ""Delete"" keys, which are reversed to me on most Mac keyboards). I use those keys often, and being able to easily switch those to a format I am familiar with was a great thing.

Corner-testing (i.e. hitting the key on the edge instead of a direct strike in the center) proved more than acceptable!! I could not find a way to press the key that caused it to bind and not take the input.

It takes AAA batteries (included), so switching those out is not an issue.

MOUSE
The mouse worked as described. The battery here is built in and not replace-able. That means you MUST recharge it with the USB-b adapter. Not a big deal, as I charged it some time ago when I first got it and haven't done so again since. However, if it goes dead, I'll have to plug it in again to charge before I can use it. If it goes dead when I need it most, I can't just hot-swap new batteries. I'll have to take a few minutes out of my day to let it charge a bit and reconnect.

The left/right keys were a little soft, but still had a decent tactile ""click"" feel. That is important on a mouse to know when you've clicked/triggered something.

The center scroll wheel is also a ""middle button"" for those unix geeks like myself. Very nice, and worked well. Just press down on it and it will have a nice solid ""click"". The wheel responded well, and scrolled in steps, as expected.

Over all, very, very happy with this purchase.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The Surface Go doesn't come with a keyboard or mouse, and so I decided to pick up an inexpensive set that got good reviews (she is 5 and still learning).

The keyboard came with batteries installed (a plus), and the mouse was not pre-charged but quickly charged up.

I proceeded to pair the mouse first -- and while it did pair, it took an extremely long time to do so. The mouse would not register movement on most surfaces - and even on a mouse pad was extremely choppy and laggy. To ensure it was not the (new) computer, I hooked up another Amazon bluetooth mouse that I have here at home and had no issue.

The keyboard WILL NOT register with the Surface Go. I followed the instructions to a tee, including rebooting both computer and keyboard to attempt to pair -- but it doesn't even show up as an available device to pair.

I will say that the keyboard itself feels of decent quality, though the edges are a bit rough/sharp. The keys feel responsive and springy. The mouse is okay, as well --if a bit cheap feeling -- but it is extremely thin, low, and long -- not ideal for little hands.

Aesthetically, this is a nice product. It may well work better with an iPad or an Android tablet -- I don't know and can't say. But as far as a Windows tablet/computer, I would stay away.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I actually had a lot of connectivity issues at first, and I’m still trying to fix some settings, but I think it’s less likely the fault of the keyboard and mouse and more likely that my iPad 10.2 (2019) just makes if complicated to set up. My iPad was able to connect to the keypad effortlessly. However, the iPad was picking up the mouse even though the mouse seemed to be attempting to connect (light was flashing). I had to go into accessibility and access “Bluetooth devices” rather than using the basic Bluetooth menu. When I went there it was able to detect the mouse. But then it was prompting for me to enter a PIN when I had not been provided one. I spent more than an hour trying to set the mouse up, but like I said I think the iPad I have just made it difficult. I didn’t know what to do about the pin but after searching the Internet, some sites suggested to try using “0000”, which is typically a default pin, and thankfully it worked!! Overall I’m actually really impressed with this product, it’s lightweight and easy to use once paired. Also, I have to fix some more settings in accessibility, because the scroll only works sometimes. But as far as the keyboard and mouse go, they seem to be good quality for what you pay for (: I’m overall satisfied it just requires patience and attention to detail with the pairing process on some devices.

   purchased this keyboard because it looks really cool and gave a nice vibe. always thought the type writer style looked cool so i ended up buying this one. out the box it comes with just the keyboard and small manual. the manual shows how many modes the keyboard is capable of and how to do certain shortcuts to activate it. first impressions are that the lights are very bright and colorful! each key is individually lit up rather than the whole keyboard, which makes it look more high quality and the colors do not drown each other out. as far as the switches go, being that it is a cheaper keyboard, the blue switches are not genuine. but despite that, it still clicks and types nicely and i have nothing to complain about in that aspect. the only con i would personally say is that it is a little big difficult to get used to typing on. since the keys are flat and super close together, it is easy to slip up on typing. other than that, i am very satisfied with how the keyboard looks, feels, and performs.

Each key is individually lit with each row being assigned a different color. From top to bottom: Blue, orange, green, pink, purple and white. The keys, although made of plastic, feel sturdy and sit on top of an aluminum panel. The mechanical keystrokes are very satisfying. There are also several different color pattern options that can be changed by utilizing the FN+Ins key .The patterns vary but the colors per row of keys cannot be changed.

The size of it is perfect for me and the keys feel similar to a laptop keyboard. I can easily switch between computers without grabbing another keyboard.

I’ve had it for a few weeks and I’m happy based on the price, Bluetooth Connection and built in rechargeable battery. Note the battery came fully charged out of the book. I haven’t had to charge it so I can’t comment on that yet.

A few comments.
1) I wish there was a control key on the right side of the space bar instead of the windows button (I like being able to do Carl-alt-del with one hand.
2) this may be Bluetooth 3.0 based on the name of the device when pairing. Not a dealbreaker but a newer version would have been nice if it is truly 3.0
3) with a compact keyboard I’m missing a dedicated page up / down button. Not a fault of the keyboard just something I miss.

Arteck Universal Bluetooth Keyboard Multi-Device Stainless Steel Full Size Wireless Keyboard for Windows, iOS, Android, Computer Desktop Laptop Surface Tablet Smartphone Built in Rechargeable Battery






",,Arteck,,Jeremy R. King,"Great Compact, Full-Featured Keyboard - very close to perfect","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2020","I ordered this keyboard with a specific need and a specific set of criteria.

My ""need"" is to have a keyboard that can switch between my tablet and phone in my home office setup. My main keyboard/mouse and screens are driven by my laptop and used for work during the day, but I keep a 10"" Windows tablet and my iPhone handy to check on personal things like Amazon orders and to text at various times during the day.

My criteria are as follows:
- Must be Bluetooth without a dongle, and able to connect with and switch between multiple devices (in my case, 2)
- Must be be close to a full-sized keyboard, but not take up much space on my desk. 10 key number pad is a plus.
- The layout and key travel / feel must be good - I'm picky about my typing.
- Must have multimedia controls to quickly pause, skip, change volume, etc. on music I listen to

This keyboard met all of those criteria, and was fairly inexpensive as well. Here is my overall impression of the keyboard.

- The key travel is short, but somehow the feel is pretty good. You get good feedback for actuation of the keys (unlike my Acer R14) and the keys are not overly easy to press, nor are they overly hard. I'm impressed with the feel for such a slim keyboard.
- There are LEDs above the three bluetooth device selection buttons which do a pretty good job telling me which device is connected, and what the status of Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Fn Lock are. The light turns blue for the selected device, if none of the options are active. If you turn on one of the Lock functions, the LED for that function turns green. So theoretically there would be a problem knowing which device is active if you had multiple Windows computers with Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Fn Lock all active - the lights would just all be green regardless of which device you selected. But for me, I have my phone on 1, which only has the blue selection light over 1 on when it is selected. And I keep my tablet on 2 and have Num Lock on, Caps Lock off, and Fn Lock off. So between these two devices, I can tell which one is active. Do note that when the keyboard goes to sleep, these lights turn off until the keyboard is woken up. So if the keyboard is asleep, you cannot tell which device is active on it.
- Battery life has been excellent. I have charged the keyboard about once every 2 weeks, but not sure that I needed to. The keyboard does automatically go to sleep after inactivity (does not sleep too quickly, but I'm not sure what the exact timing is), so some people might get annoyed with having to manually wake it after a period of non-use. To wake it, you can either just activate the device (which I do by jiggling the mouse on the tablet or unlocking my phone with a swipe), or you can hit a key. Any key will work if it's asleep, as the first key press will only wake the keyboard, not actually register on the device. It does take a second or two to wake up, which does not bother me - I just wait for the lights, but I have read reviews for other keyboards where this delay is very annoying for some.
- The keyboard sits nicely on my desk and is really very rigid, thanks to the metal construction, including a pretty strong metal strip on the front which keeps everything from flexing. The overall construction seems very good at this price point. It also looks very nice.

So far, I have found only two annoyances, and neither of those would cause me to lower the rating of the keyboard.

- There are no dedicated Home, End, Pg Up, or Pg Dn keys, which I use a lot normally. The workaround for this is to turn Num Lock off and use the 10 digit keypad, which has these functions clearly marked. Since it is easy to toggle Num Lock, I'm OK with this. Would prefer to have these functions added to the arrow keys using the Fn key or have dedicated keys, but oh well.
- I keep Fn Lock OFF normally so that I can use the multimedia keys across the top to control Spotify. However, when I switch to my phone and switch back to the Windows tablet, the keyboard (or maybe Windows itself) automatically activates Fn Lock. So every time I switch, I have to re-disable the Fn Lock. Again, this is pretty easy to do with a dedicated key and I've gotten in the habit of doing it, but would definitely be better if it remembered my last state.

All said, I don't think I could find a better keyboard for my particular use case. I am definitely happy with this keyboard and would recommend it to anyone, as long as the quirks are known and acceptable.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$39.99 ,Jelly Comb,,R. W. Harobed,"Very Good, Sturdy Keyboard","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2019","Overall, I am quite pleased with this little keyboard.

I'm a big fan of bluetooth keyboards, especially ones that are compact enough that I can carry them around with me. I've been looking for a non-folding, sturdy full-sized keyboard for a while, and have gone through several disappointing boards from local retailers. When I found this one, I was really pleased.

For one thing, this keyboard doesn't require additional batteries. Just plug it in via the USB drive, charge it up, and go. No need to hassle with AAA batteries or anything like that. The battery life is pretty good, too. I've owned the keyboard for over a week now, and have only charged it once--and that wasn't because it really needed it, more because I was being paranoid.

The edges of the keyboard are pretty smooth. They don't catch on my clothing (unlike my other attempts), and don't irritate me when I'm trying to write with the keyboard in my lap. The thicker, upper-edge of the keyboard is curved. Overall, it's an appealing design.

I also like the heft of this device. It's not featherweight--you know it's there--but in a pleasant way. It's not heavy enough to be a burden, not light enough to feel cheap.

Pairing isn't hard. Sometimes my other devices (apple products) didn't want to recognize the keyboard right away. With a little patience, everything worked out the way it was supposed to. Once paired, the keyboard connects without issue the next time you turn it on.

So, yeah, this is a really good little keyboard. I really enjoy using it and have taken to it pretty quickly, unlike some keyboards that take time for me to adjust.

",$39.99 ,Jelly Comb,,PixelPusher,Just an ok keyboard but decent value for the money,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020","At first glance this is a sharp keyboard with a good design. It's slim and well laid out. There aren't a ton of keyboards designed for Mac so it is nice to find one at a good price but doesn't sacrifice too much on looks.

That being said, as someone that designs computer interfaces for a living the misalignment of the letters and symbols on the keyboard are absolutely maddening. Some may not care but to me, it bothers me everytime I look at it. Just how bad is their tooling that they can't make sure things line up. For instance, the '<' is a 1/16"" higher than the '>' and they're right next to each other. Then there are a lot of other labels that aren't even close to being centered. Ugh.

My other complaint is the texture on the keys. Comparing this to my 2018 MacBook Pro and wired Apple Keyboard, the keys on the Jelly Comb are more textured and less smooth. This might be because the material they used, if they made them smooth then the keys would be too slippery. Just a guess. Either way, it makes for a slightly cheap feel.

Last small complaint is that the charging port is micro USB and not USB-C.

Overall, the key presses feel decent and aren't mushy, the battery life seems decent and all of the Mac shortcuts work. So there's not functional limitations that I've run into.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

X9 Performance Slim Wired Keyboard for Laptop or Desktop - Designed for Windows PC - Convenient Full Size 110 Key Layout with 17 Shortcuts and 2 Port USB Hub - Plug and Play USB Keyboard - Aluminum






",,X9 Performance,Multimedia,Metryq,Fell in love with it immediately,"Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2020","Okay, this is a really nice keyboard. I've been spoiled by the Apple keyboards, but needed something ""made for Windows"" as I migrated to Linux. The Apple keyboard works fine, but is missing a few keys if you're doing more than visiting some other OS for the afternoon. Macally makes some really nice hardware, but again, oriented to the Mac.

Some keyboards might have Ctrl on the ""outside"" (as with this keyboard), others may have it one key inside from the edge. So depending on your preferences, and maybe ""muscle memory,"" it is something to consider. Some keyboards have a Fn key (like this keyboard), others may not. For Linux I want that—and it has a ""caps lock"" function for the Fn key, too. So if you have preferences as to ""always Fn"" or ""always media, etc."" you can switch on the fly without opening a control panel. Numlock as well, no need to install numlockx.

Overall, the keys just *feel* nice. I tried a few other keyboards here on Amazon. And one that I generally liked had a sleepy W key. I could tap-tap-tap wake it up, then it would work fine. But even then, the keys were stiffer, had a pebbled texture that seemed to be polishing my fingerprints off, and didn't seem as ""transparent"" as that ""Apple keyboard"" feel I was looking for. This keyboard has it.

The feature that decided my purchase? The keys have a very gentle concave depression (along with the usual dimples on the F and J keys). And that makes my fingers feel more ""centered"" as I type. It's a muscle sensation too fast to think about, but it makes a difference. The bottom row (on the main keys) are all slightly convex.

Well made, comfortable, responsive. I'm going to buy another one right now for another workstation. These keys feel so good, I think they're improving my typing speed.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  First of all, the galaxy s7+ is the apple pro killer we were waiting for. No more having to play around ""apple knows best."" What could go wrong? Well, the case could go wrong. This caused so much frustration because the s7+ is a good device. The Good: Keyboard is better decent, actually not bad at all to type on. The Bad: The trackpad is limited to the point that it would've been better to not include it. You can't double tap to highlight text (magic keyboard can't as well) you can't go back or forward with swipes, you cannot CONTROL THE SPEED of the trackpad! (it's a zippy mess). When hovering over some videos, you have to tap the video for the cursor to register (should be automatic), sometimes the function keys don't work, You can't press ctrl and tab into another tab, no real left click...you could go on & on. The look of the keyboard as a whole isn't aesthetic to me or objectively very functional (can't really use it on your lap) - tablets are supposed to be portable. If you use the case (top part) without the keyboard, the side of the tablet is exposed to wear & tear. This case was such a disappointment, I purchased the book cover variant. The book cover is aesthetically pleasing, but a tablet without a keyboard is just not worth the money. That's what's frustrating, rather than provide a case without a trackpad (like apple did) Samsung only gives 2 options. This ultimately means that the Samsung Galaxy s7+ regardless of how good it is, is going to be returned now. All because Samsung couldn't put resources into completing the package. There's a reason apple put effort into the Magic Keyboard, & that isn't without faults but at least its backlit!

  I bought this for my office and normal office use.  I am very easy on my keyboard and mouse and always make sure they are clean, nothing is spilled on them, and use them as most people would.  The product seemed to work great up to about 6 months after I purchased.  Within a month, the batteries needed to be replaced.  Mind you, my previous Logitech set went 2 years without its first battery replacement.  So okay, no big deal.  About 8 months after purchase, the left button of the mouse would not consistently work when having to click and hold.  Instead it would start double and triple clicking instead of the click and hold.  At almost the same time, the K and S key would sometimes not register a key hit.  A year in I had these issues and more.  Needless to say, not impressed with the long-term quality.I buy products to last a long time and not to be replaced every year.  I had my last Logitech set for 8 years before I had to replace.  Very disappointed with how long this lasted and already looking to replace.  Do not buy if you will use this regularly and want it to last.  It will not!!!

Same with the keyboard -- the wrist rest is possibly the most comfortable I've ever used and the keys are very quiet and borderline doughy, in a good way.

However, the issues (with three different sets of fresh batteries from various big-name brands):
The mouse will track fine for maybe 20 minutes, then it'll seize up and just stop, although oddly enough the buttons still work.
Worse yet is the keyboard performance. I'm talking 15-20 second delays on typing letters. If you're typing a sentence and don't notice it, you're going to go back and see a handful of letters, proceeded and followed by absolutely nothing at all.

It's incredibly frustrating given how nice the set feels. Unfortunately, if it doesn't work for navigating and typing, it's not going to get a positive review.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$123.98 ,Logitech,,Jamie E,So far really good,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020","I migrated from a Microsoft Sculpt which I have extensive tested for 5 or 6 years of programming and love the keyboard but the proprietary connectivity is so bad I had to get something else.

Comparing this to the sculpt, the key layout is close but not exact, so it will have a learning curve before you get used to it. The wrist rest is better than the sculpt, but I still like the downslope that the sculpt has. This isn't bad, the sculpt is still a more natural feel for me based on my chair and desk height. Otherwise, this keyboard feels very secure on my desk, the keys are crisp with a short press distance but very good feedback.

Setup was super easy, paired on my existing usb receiver with no problem, also can pair with my laptop using bluetooth, which is a plus.

I don't really mind the no rechargeable batteries issue, I have current rechargeable keyboards and I have to recharge them every week or two, same with my MX anywhere mouse, so not a negative for me. My star deduction is for the lack of backlight. It's not something required, but in such an expensive product, it should be in there by default, MX keys and master both have backlit keyboards and are quite a bit cheaper.

Anyway, so far it's working great, I hope it lasts a long time, it's definitely not a cheap product. If it was illuminated and/or about 20% cheaper, it would be a 5 star product.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

",$123.98 ,Logitech,,E.S.,No longer a Microsoft fanboy.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2020","Since the release of the first Microsoft Natural Keyboard, I have been a faithful consumer. For work, home computing, and even gaming (for a substantial amount of time) I clung to the comfort and reliability of my funny-looking, split-keyed companion. Earlier this year, ignoring all the negative feedback, I upgraded to the MS Surface Ergonomic keyboard, determined to remain loyal and true. I wanted to love it, and as far as comfort, feel, build materials and typing experience, I did. But like many have said, the MS keyboard is plagued with connectivity issues that render it relatively useless. On a daily basis, it would disconnect, the driver would crash, and freeze my computer. In a work environment, when your giving a presentation to dozens of people, that is just unacceptable. So into the closet it went, and I returned to my old MS wired standby.

Then, I discovered the Logitech Ergo K860. At $130 buckarinos, it was painful to purchase, but I kinda fell in love with the MS Surface Ergonomic keyboard's similar form factor and keys, that I decided to go out on a limb, and give the Logitech a shot. I was not disappointed.

I already use the Logi wireless receiver for my trackball mouse, so I didn't even have to take up an extra USB port to use the keyboard. I simply opened up the logitech software, turned on the keyboard, and boom it connected flawlessly. I haven't had a single disconnect, or issue with mysteriously typing multiple characters, or system lag; all of which were constant with the MS board.

I really like the thickness of the wrist pad and the ability to raise the slope of the keyboard up or down depending on your preference. I have an adjustable standing desk, so that feature comes in handy. The feel of the keys are comparable to the MS, though it is slightly edged out by the Surface keyboard. Same goes for the look, however, I'll take a functioning black keyboard over a slightly more attractive defective gray one any day of the week.

The only thing I would ding this keyboard on is the shape of some of the keys. I won't go into each one specifically, as I expect that I'll eventually get used to all of them with time. Still it's a bit awkward while touch typing training your fingers to move over a few centimeters.

I highly recommend this keyboard for anyone who is disappointed with MS's newest offering, wants to free themselves from a wired keyboard, likes the feel of laptop style keys, and prefers the comfort of a split key, ergonomic design.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE

The K860 fixed a few problems I was having with my older K350 ergonomic keyboard (mostly minor issues and personal preference things):
-Official Mac support - the keys on the K860 have the proper Command and Option key logos/labeling. Not a huge problem, but it would get a little annoying to try and remember that the Start key for a Windows keyboard was the OPT key for Mac-specific ones, for example.
-Slightly smaller size - Although its not much smaller, it looks a bit smaller on my desk compared to the K860. This is mostly because of the smaller bezels around the keys, but the keys themselves are normal sized.
- Caps-lock key light - There is now an LED that tells you if Caps Lock is engaged on the K860
-Enhanced Function Keys - The lock button locks my Mac, the calculator button opens calculator. Everything with the enhanced Function Key shortcuts work perfectly now.

The split keys were very easy to get used to, I was up to my normal typing speed within an hour. If you are a Mac user as well this one is a no-brainer due to official MacOS support.

",$36.99 ,E-YOOSO,Gaming,Pynch,Nice entry-level mechanical keyboard! Needs improving!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2019","I spend 8-9 hrs a day at my desk. Due to all the time I spend typing, the keyboard matters a great deal. I have been using this one for several weeks now. I really do like this keyboard but I will write an honest review because it should be better.

Reasons I like it
- it is a mechanical keyboard. Smooth and easy key action.
- much lighter key action, less finger fatigue
- cheap! Excellent value!

Drawbacks
- The keys are too close to each other. My big fingers keep hitting extra keys. Even after using for several weeks.
- The keys are to high above my desktop. I need to use a wrist rest to get my hands up high enough. It is a matter of things just being stacked up (keyboard base, switches, keys on top). The spacebar measures fully 1.25"" above the desktop.

I am keeping mine and using it 40-50 hrs per week. I really do like it better than the ergonomic Logitech that my boss provided. These ergonomic sins could (and should!) be addressed with a few low cost and low tech changes.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  I'm not including photos as I feel that the photos and videos other people have included are accurate representations of what I received.For reference, I've plugged this keyboard into a 2014 13"" Macbook Pro (it sounds positively Jurassic as I write that, given that it's 2020!).What I love:- The color!  Oh, the keyboard is beautiful.  There is a small instructional insert that comes with the keyboard.  It's printed in both English and Chinese.  It tells you how to change the LED pattern.  Very easy and fancy.- The backlit keys!  One reason I chose this keyboard above others was that the keys are actually backlit in such a way that you can see the letters/numbers/symbols, even in the dark.  Other keyboards didn't offer that feature.- The sound!  It is soooo clackety-clackety.  This probably isn't the keyboard for someone who needs to work in the quiet.  It's not exactly like an old electric typewriter, but it's pretty darned close.  It's much louder than computer keyboards circa 90's and 00's as far as ""clicks"" are concerned.  Personally, I love it!- The number pad - it's really convenient to have a number pad on the right side of the keyboard rather than hunting and pecking for numbers above the letters.  This is a small point, however someone who uses numbers a lot would probably agree with me.Things I Wish Were Better***There may be workarounds for what I'm about to discuss -- I need to do further research***- Function Keys such as ""End"" or key combinations such as ""ALT + TAB"" don't work as normal on my Mac.  It's only slightly irritating so far.- Nothing else!In conclusion, super cool keyboard.  Fun and loud for creative writing -- the sound makes me feel like I'm really accomplishing something!  Not sure how well it works for gaming, as that's not my purpose, but for normal day-to-day keyboard usage it's excellent.

",$36.99 ,E-YOOSO,Gaming,Jordan,More for looks than practicality,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2019","I do enjoy using this keyboard, but it's definitely designed to look nice rather than function as well as it could. This is due to the shape of the keys; it makes it fairly difficult to type/play on without looking at the keys. It's also fairly difficult to quickly switch between keys, press multiple at the same time, etc. This is again just due to the shape of the keys, I suppose you'll get used to it but it isn't the most practical for gaming.

The switches under the keys are nice, fairly similar to the blue switches by Cherry. They do make a very nice clicking sound when you type, but it is also very loud so you should be aware of that.

The lights on the keyboard also look very nice, although they did not work the first time I plugged the keyboard into my MacBook. I was surprised when they turned on right away when I plugged the keyboard into my PC, and since then they work on my MacBook as well.

It's a nice keyboard overall, especially for the price. I have gotten many compliments on it, but it is definitely more for looks than anything else.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard for Mac/iPad/Android/Windows, Jelly Comb Slim Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with Number Pad| Seamless Switch Among 3 Devices (White and Silver, Rechargeable)






",$29.99 ,Jelly Comb,,,"A nice keyboard, looks like apple keyboard","Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2020","
  The first thing about this is that the keyboard resembles an apple keyboard which is nice if you trying to replace it. The next thing is that you do not need to install any new batteries into this as it come with a battery built in which is great. It does use bluetooth to connect giving a better response time. Although this keyboard looks like a mac keyboard, it has the same layout a standard PC keyboard. It also is not the best keyboard to use if you are trying to troubleshoot a mac unfortunately as it does not connect to the PC during boot up which is unfortunate. The keyboard response is pretty nice. There is not noticeable lag and I am able to type well with this keyboard. The keys feel okay. I would say compared to an original mac keyboard, it definitely feels cheaper. What I like about this is that you can recharge it and there are LED light indicators to show things like the cap lock and a power indicator to show if you need to recharge your device. It also has an on and off button so you are able to turn the device off easily when not in use. You can pair this to pretty much all operating systems from macs to android devices. The keyboard works pretty well. You only need to sync it once and it will automatically sync up after that. What is nice about this is that you can set it to different channels so you are able to connect to different devices without needing to repair them. You can set up to three devices and switch between them. I usually use this when I am working on both my mac and PC at the same time. I can switch my keyboard very quickly. The one down side is that it does us a standard micro USB to charge it and not a type c so you may have a harder time plugging this into say a macbook pro. The device works for quite sometimes before you need to recharge it again. I had it working for several days before the light indicator came on. It only takes up to about five hours or so to fully charge. The keys are white so be careful when leaving this out in the sun as you may bleach the keys. Overall this keyboard is a good replacement for a macbook keyboard. It allows you to connect several devices and has a pretty nice distance as well. I was able to go about 15 or so feet before it started having issues with connectivity. It feels cheaper than a mac keyboard but works well none the less.

Multi-Device Bluetooth Keyboard for Mac/iPad/Android/Windows, Jelly Comb Slim Compact Bluetooth Keyboard with Number Pad| Seamless Switch Among 3 Devices (White and Silver, Rechargeable)






",$29.99 ,Jelly Comb,,Bert,Surprisingly useful and versatile,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2020","Disclaimer: I was provided this keyboard for free so I could review it.

Pros:
* Thin, light, sturdy
* Typing feels smooth and key sizes are normal.
* Included rubberized keyboard protector is helpful and adds grip to the keys.
* Multimedia keys work as expected.
* Pairing is fast and switching channels works reliably so far.

Cons:
* No battery gauge shows on the notification bar (at least on LineageOS 14.1 (Android 7.1.2) )

Look and feel:
My first thought was that it was a lot thinner than I'd expected it to be. It's also incredibly light, and yet sturdy. The frame is probably plastic and you're able to twist it very slightly if you try, but it definitely doesn't feel cheap. It feels simple and sturdy, rather than the hefty feel you get from standard cabled keyboards.

The look is very clean and simple, and yet you can tell it has a decent amount of features built in. The buttons are right where you'd expect them to be and the key spacing matches other keyboards, so there's not a worry that I'd have to spend time getting used to it.

The key switches are chiclet (I think it's called), like you'd find in a standard laptop. They click easily and with what I feel is the right amount of pressure. There's also a rubberized flexible membrane included in the box that covers the keyboard, from just before the bottom edge to below the indicator lights on the top edge. It's kind of like the keyboard protectors you see on MacBook Air laptops, the one everyone gets to protect against spills and stuff. It's thinner than that, but very nice to have as added protection and it gives the keys a very noticeable grip.

I also notice very few mistypings, which are very likely due to me using the keyboard on my lap. I don't feel like there's any issue with the keystrokes not registering properly.

Bluetooth pairing/switching:
The process for pairing is very straightforward; hold the channel button you wish to pair until that light flashes, find the keyboard in your device's Bluetooth list, and pair. I'm surprised at how easy and quick it was for Android and my software keyboard (Swiftkey) works seamlessly with it, still showing predictions on the bottom of my screen.

Multimedia keys:
These seem to work very quickly and well. I couldn't get the brightness to adjust, but this is likely due to me running a custom OS on my tablet, so it will likely work perfectly well for you.

The Home key on the top right works exactly as expected on Android, as did the Alt + Tab app carousel function for Android. Just make sure to keep holding Alt while you're moving through your apps and selecting one, or else it'll go away just like it does for Windows.

Battery life:
The manual states 50 hours of runtime and I haven't been able to fully test this, as I got this keyboard as an occasional use item for my tablet/phone. I certainly expect you'd get a lot of use time out of this. The only big flaw I can tell is that there's no way to tell the battery charge, either on the keyboard itself or the device it's connected to. Granted, this could be an issue with how Android/my tablet operate, but it'd be very helpful to have that.

All in all, this is a really helpful keyboard. While I probably wouldn't use it for my day job, it works amazingly as an input device for a phone/tablet.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$29.99 ,Jelly Comb,,B,"great full size multi-device bluetooth keyboard, with numeric keypad","Reviewed in the United States on April 17, 2020","
  I got my item within 2-3 days, sooner than promised. Wonderful experience right out of the box. The Keyboard was fully charged - a nice touch when you are ready to try it out, without needing to charge first. The design is beautiful and makes you want to use it. Some thing I really love about it are the 3 bluetooth channels (for multiple device users like me, this is a huge time saver to avoid re-pairing), and the numeric keypad (it's very hard to find that on a bluetooth keyboard.) It paired perfectly well with several devices I tried (an Asus android tablet, and a Linux-based Lenovo ideapad). It's a good full size keyboard, very helpful so you can sit a further distance from a smaller laptop and gives you a real normal size keyboard too.  The look is very solid and well-designed aluminum and white, very much like products from another very famous tech company, this unit would match perfectly. It also has a nice built in molding in the back to give it the right incline for typing, much better than the little fold out legs most keyboards use.  I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller. Great quality!

Rechargeable Wireless Keyboard Mouse Combo, Jelly Comb 2.4GHz Ultra Slim Compact Full Size Wireless Keyboard Mouse for Laptop, PC, Desktop Computer, Windows OS






",$33.99 ,,,Walter A. Avalos,"Perfect in function, comes with dirt cover! AWESOME CALCULATOR KEY.","Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2020","Pros:
- Price for keyboard quality
- As small as can be with full Key Pad
- True Plug-n-Play out of the box (No driver download)
- Has a key designated to lock user screen when AFK
- Has Calculator Key! Yes, your calculator will pop right up, press it again to magnify it!
- Comes with dirt cover
- Primary function keys (F1, etc.) are for volume/pause/internet, etc. keys, not F1-F10 (Can be ""locked"" to normal F1-F11. You'll have to press ""fn"" for these, usually it's the other way around for volume/brightness control).
- Power, Num lock, Caps lock bright LED lights turn off when not typing (great for night time), turn back on when typing.

Cons:
- Mouse is not as quality like keyboard, cheap all around (but I don't use it I have my own vertical ergonomic)
- Arrow Up/Down keys are half keys combined into one. Visible on product images, no surprise, but really sucks with the dirt cover own because there's no ridge separating them. Really sucks, but that's how all short keyboards are.
- Angled slight high compared to flat laptop keyboard, not ergonomic on wrists :( wish it were just flat.
- Dirt cover ridges not deep enough between keys, translucent super milky/foggy ruins look.
- Primary function keys are for volume/play/internet, etc. keys, not F1-F10 (Can be ""locked"" to normal F1-F11). (You'll have to press ""fn"" for these, usually it's the other way around for volume/brightness control).
- Power, Num lock, Caps lock bright LED lights turn off when not typing (great for night time), turn back on when typing.

I only needed the short keyboard with number pad to fit my stand up desk surface with mouse pad on top of my regular desk and this one looked the best. Plugged it in to charge with cable, and I tried turning it on and connect it through bluetooth, was not discovered by laptop. Needed the USB dongle inside the mouse I am not using. Plug that in to my laptop, work like magic, all volume, brightness, even internet key popped my browser right up. Magic.

Love it that the F1-F11 Keys are not primary and instead it's the volume control and internet browser, email client keys. You can ""lock"" them back to regular F1-F11 keys, and press the ""fn"" keys instead to control volume like a normal laptop. I work with Excel spreadsheets all day and use F4, F11 macro and F8 keys but I don't mind having to pres ""fn"" or locking them back in place for that. I'd rather have volume control conveniently ready to tap. Only inconvenience might be refreshing pages with F5.

LEDs for caps lock or other functions turn completely off when not typing, come back on as soon as you press a key. I love it for night, but I can see myself forgetting the Caps Lock is still on though. Probably saves battery in the long run so I'm not complaining.

Directional UP/Down arrows are cut in half and merged into one key space with hardly any separation between them, but that's how all short keyboards are cut. Really sucks with the dirt cover though, feels like they're just one key. Sucks for Excel/Gaming when you need the up/down arrows quickly.

The designated key for locking user when stepping away from keyboard is awesome, but not as awesome as the calculator key! I'm used to pressing windows key to get start menu up, then start typing ""calc"" then press enter to pop up the calculator. I thought I was cool doing that quickly. Nope, not as cool as having a designated key for it. They really put a lot of thought into this keyboard! Pressing it twice magnifies the calculator, both for accessibility (not me) and using far away multiple screens (totally me) when using a varidesk standing up with one screen high, and looking down at the other screen where I'm using the calculator. I freaking love that magnify key.

Whenever I buy any new electronics I like to put a screen protector or cover new right out of the box. I was surprised it came with the dirt cover. Put it on right out of the box instead of looking to buy one that would fit. Even though the ridges between keys are not deep enough, and it's milky and ugly looking, I'm known to break chocolate pieces in half not realizing the heat from my fingers are melting a bit of chocolate that got stuck on them and smudging it allover my keyboard. Thanks for including it at this budget price!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I'm a die-hard fan of Logitech peripherals. because of that it was very difficult for me to get something other than their brand. But I was disappointed in the keyboard wireless keyboard and mouse that I bought from them. The mouse was good with the keyboard was lacking in many ways. I found that the reliability of the connection was not as good meaning that you know if I was too far from the computer or the doggle that has been placed into my computer I sometimes would get a latency or it would not detect the keyboard for typing. With this keyboard and mouse however I did not experience any of those things. The keyboard is as responsive as the mouse and there was no noticeable lag or latency while using it. I didn't even have to charge the devices before use I got it out of the box plugged it in and got down to business. I was amazed also the how Finn the keyboard is yet sturdy but I do still wander and I'm worried whether or not it will break. I highly recommend.

  I’m editing this review to let you know as far as battery life I have owned it for 4 months and not charged it once since I’ve owned it and I never turn it off.  The mouse I just had to charge for the first time yesterday, but I think only because it got stuck in my couch cushion by accident and the button was held for hours on end.  Only issue I have is sometimes every so often it randomly acts like someone is holding the 6 key down.  Maybe it’s possessed?  Otherwise it has been well worth the money.Nice little set.  Easy to set up, just plug in the receiver and turn it on and go with Windows 10.  The set is sleek and doesn’t take up a lot of space.  I like the thin size of the mouse and the ergonomics of it.  I use it to hook up my laptop to my TV and control it from my couch and it works flawlessly.  The charge has lasted several days and I even left it on for 2 days straight as both components go to sleep when not in use but wake up instantly when you need them.  Really happy with this set.

  As others have noted, the keyboard is wonderful.  I love the touch of the keys.  They have a good amount of resistance.  I love the ""jelly"" silicone keyboard cover.  The keyboard is amazingly thin and lightweight.  I've had keyboards before that would drop keystrokes occasionally.  This one never does.  The keyboard has a good battery life, even when I forget to turn it off, which is MOST of the time.  The mouse feels good in my hand.  I like the feel of the clickers, and the wheel.  So what's not to like?  Other reviews have mentioned it.  It takes TOO LONG for the mouse to re-establish connection when the screen blanks.  I've quit using the mouse for this reason.  I suppose I could use it as a backup, or in situations where a wireless mouse would be a big advantage.  Otherwise, it's not worth the nuisance factor.

Good things about this keyboard that come to mind:
-No wasted space, keys everywhere
-Keys & switches are very good - tactile and very responsive
-Detachable cable so when you need to carry it, you can pack the cable and keyboard separately
-True RGB backlighting with modes like reactive touch (the key you press illuminates) and it is customizable.
-No software required for backlight, fully managed by onboard controller (this means no drivers and works w/any OS).
-Comes in a cool box and very well packaged

Some things to be aware of:
-The right shift key (smaller) takes some getting used to, but I think it's worth it to have arrow keys on such a compact keyboard.
-The instructions on how to control backlighting are unclear in the manual, but found that here on Amazon so it wasn't a problem. I'll summarize my findings below to make it easy for whoever reads this.

To customize the backlight, first hold down the FN key.
With FN key held down:
- Up/Down arrows to control backlight brightness
- Left/Right arrows to control color
-Tilde (~) key to go into individual key customization mode (caps lock button will start flashing). In this mode, press individual keys (and their color will change with each press) until they are your desired color. Then FN+Tilde will save that config and that will be what you get when you press FN+Tilde again. (Pressing twice will trigger customization mode)
- F8 to cycle through different modes (there are a lot and some are dynamic and affected by your typing speed for example).",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$59.99 ,,,永 伟,Almost for touch-typists,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2020","
  The first one I ordered was faulty so I sent it back for a second one.  This one is good so far, it's just out of the box.  The only complaint I have is the right shift key is absolutely tiny.  As a touch-typist, but one that isn't really fantastic at it, the tiny shift key makes it very hard to locate with your right pinky.  Thankfully I have a set of rubber ""cabinet bumpers"" that I used on my last keyboard to make the F and the J keys more pronounced (once again, for help in touch typing) and I've added that to the tiny right shift key to make it easier to hit with my right pinky.The size is great, it fits right on my lap as I'm reclining to type without hanging over either side.Minus one star for the tiny shift key.=======================After using it for a few days, I am not overly fond of the tactile response.  I'm more used to the easy press of the microsoft ergo sculpt keyboard while this one takes a much more forceful keypress that someone used to a mechanical keyboard rather than a membrane keyboard might be prone to use.  Though I don't know many fans of mechanical keyboards that will switch to a membrane keyboard.  If you're used to the much easier press of the microsoft sculpt keyboard, these keys will feel like they are sticking, at first, but you really just need to hammer the keys a bit harder than you're used to, it's like the worst of both worlds.

  I was looking for a split keyboard that was smaller (did not have a 10-key).  I bought this one to try it out.  The angle of the mouse takes some getting used to, but the action was smooth and it worked very well.  The keyboard's angle of the palm rest felt nicer than my old Logitec.  I prefer a sharper ""split"" than this keyboard offers, but I believe its a fairly typical angle for ergonomic keyboards.  Small complaints:  the action of the keys is a little squishier / less-clicky than I'm used to, also the top-row / numeric-keys almost feel further away than on a standard keyboard.  Overall, would purchase this keyboard over a similarly priced standard Logitec / Microsoft keyboard.  However, as I am looking for ""the best keyboard at any cost"" I will continue to look.

  The keyboard is the size of an average laptop length wise. If this is an issue for you, buy a bigger keyboard to help suit your needs. For the price, you get an ergonomic mouse with it. I found it easy to set up and it helped with my wrist tremendously compared to a traditional keyboard. Now, I need to get used to typing with an ergonomic keyboard.

",$169.98 ,,,MaryKay,"OMG, amazing THIN keyboard case!","Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2020","I balked at paying the high price, but I couldn’t find a cheap iPad Pro 11 2020 cover that was available in less than 3 weeks due to the coronavirus shipping slowdown on Amazon. After dropping my 10.5 and cracking the screen (open case, no screen protector), I didn’t want to take any chances with this new expensive tablet. I’m so happy I ordered this case (along with a glass screen protector!) and I got it in 2 days.

The keyboard works great, no need to connect and reconnect. And you can fold it back for use without the keyboard, especially when in portrait mode. The build is solid. Magnets secure it to the ipad’s front and back, and it feels as sturdy as a small laptop. The keyboard is smaller than my Magic Keyboard but it takes no time at all to get used to this one. Keys aren’t as responsive but you get used to that too if you’re a good old school “typist” like me.

I don’t know how Apple made this thing so thin but sturdy. Also love that the outside of the case is not slick or slippery. Feels velvety (not tacky) and secure in the hands or on a surface when folded closed. The only con you might see is the aluminum edges on 3 sides are not covered. But that leaves one long edge open for charging my pencil.

I still feel the cost is high and I probably wouldn’t have considered this purchase if there were cheaper cases available in 2 days. But I’m actually glad I had to. And it will be great for travel. In the meantime I may never buy a cheaper everyday case for normal use. I like this one too much!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$169.98 ,,,Amazon Customer,Very Reliable,"Reviewed in the United States on August 6, 2020","To set the stage, I tried two Bluetooth keyboards (Zagg & Chesona-sp?) prior to buying this Apple keyboard. After dozens of hours on line with Zagg and Apple tech support and multiple returns and exchanges, I gave up on the Bluetooth keyboards (same issue with the Chesona); I was constantly having to try and pair. I even went so far as to have Apple download my iPad system info and send it to ""Engineering."" At the end of the day, I just couldn't stand messing with the Bluetooth keyboards. I see reviews from plenty who don't have that problem, but for those who do, this review is for you.

The Apple keyboard pros/cons-

Pros:

Well built
Thin
Reliable
Does not require charging (it runs off the iPads juice)
The keyboard is sealed, you can't spill fluid into the keys
Locks into position with a magnet-nice

Cons:
Expensive-ish
The iPad easily detaches from the cover backing. Prepare to always be on guard for accidentally detaching the iPad. If you pick up the folio part without having a grip on the iPad too, the iPad is going to come loose
It only locks in two pre-determined viewing positions (you can fold the keypad in half for table use)
Protective? A little bit, but it doesn't appear to be built to give a lot of impact protection.

Bottom line: The Zagg is a superior design by far. Unfortunately, for me the Zagg was not reliable, which makes the Apple Keyboard Folio my choice. If not for the Bluetooth issues, I would go with the Zagg in a second.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I purchased this keyboard because I am long time fan of the consistent quality I receive from Redragon products and I was in need of a non-mechanical keyboard for my girlfriend as she doesn't enjoy the clicking of a mechanical keyboard, yet does enjoy the feeling of typing on one. This keyboard is a perfect choice for anyone that is looking to get that mechanical like feeling without all the noise. It is very quiet to type on and the keys provide a good amount of resistance as if you were typing on actual mechanical keyboard (might be a bit heavier resistance than my k580). Apart from the keyboard itself, I did have some issues adjusting my typing as they put the 'G' keys on the left side instead of top like some of my other boards. I kept making mistakes at first when typing, but that is something that is negligible once your hands are adjusted for the keyboard. Another thing that I do not count against this keyboard is that there are less options for color animations. The led's are bright and beautiful, but you only have about 7 options of setup compared to my other boards that had up to 18. This is understandable though, as unlike my mechanical boards, the leds on this board are not individualized to each key, but rather share 1/6 of the board at a time. If you use the customized lighting configuration (which is poorly explained how to use in the manual), you will see that after activating it using Fn+PgUp, you then use the Fn+(1-6 keys located on the top row only) to set each sixth of the board to a specific stationary color (And then locked in by pressing Fn+PgUp again). Because the leds are limited to sections rather than each key, there are clearly restrictions that limit amount of possible animation configurations. For me personally, I was not bothered as I only use the option that pans the rainbow across the board anyways. The last thing to talk about is the palm rest. It is hard plastic with a very nice texture and Redragon logo in the middle. It does add much needed comfort to this board as I found it sits higher up than most of my other boards. It is very to remove as well. The palm rest is magnetic (look at pictures). There is nothing special you need to do to attach or remove it. Just line up the rests magnets with the boards metal tabs and it hook right on and won't pop off on it's own. Removing it is as simple as just pulling it off. Overall, I think this keyboard is perfect for those who enjoy a mechanical feel, but either don't enjoy the sounds of a mechanical board (or have family that don't like hearing it). This board provides excellent performance and responsiveness that I always happy to see from Redragon.

  As quality keyboards seem harder to come by in this day and age, I decided to give this one a shot, since cheaper keyboards tended to break down fairly quickly (in relative terms) for me. As I get a lot of use out of my keyboards, it was important to me to find a quality keyboard, at a price I could reasonably afford. It's too early to tell yet, of course, but I believe I've found one, in this particular keyboard. The keys feel just right when pressed - not too stiff, not too light - and I especially appreciate how this keyboard is backlit, which helps in often-dark rooms (such as mine), and of course this also means that these key labels won't ""rub off"" like so many cheap ones tend to. I also appreciate how it's basically plug and play, and how the colored backlighting is controlled internally by the keyboard - I didn't have to install some third-party driver to get most of the functions to work (and the others are likely configurable by hand, since I use Linux as my primary desktop). I've never heard of PicTek before, but if they maintain this consistent quality over the long haul, I would not hesitate to purchase from them again!

CON~space bar is weak and causes me to add more spaces than intended when pushed, so i have to constantly go back and correct...
CON~spaces between the tops of the keys are too large causing me type slower, they are not close together..
CON~another downside is where the slash key is right next to the enter key,

  I searched for days on amazon, reading reviews to find the perfect wireless keyboard. While it's not bluetooth, which is what I was originally shopping for, it has worked out perfectly. It's lightweight, but doesn't feel like cheap plastic, The non skid pads are conveniently placed, the size is exactly what I was looking for (among other things) and that was hard to come by. I'm happy it has a 10 key, the only minor challenge I have is that I type very quickly and I'm so used to my keyboard at work, that I often hit a wrong key because it's slightly smaller than a 17"" and I didn't think about that being a challenge when I first shopped for it. I'll get use to it probably just in time to go back to my office and mess up on that keyboard :). The keyboard didn't come with batteries even though the instruction manual said they were included. I popped in two old batteries I had in a drawer and it works just fine on the battery life. The mouse is also nice and sleek, easy to use and scrolling and clicking is a breeze. No complaints here. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a great wireless keyboard for home and or travel.

",,GAMCATZ,,Julie,Not completely ideal for writers 😕,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2020","
  So the reason  I gave this keyboard 3 stars was because I feel that it isn't exactly ideal for typing. The backspace button is way too close to the delete button and both are the same small size. I find I accidentally hit the delete button instead of the backspace button when I am in my typing g groove and it has caused me errors with some of the programs I use. I did not think this was going to be an issue when I bought it but it has become one.One other thing was that the keyboard takes batteries and the mouse needs to be charged.. this was a little confusing at first and I had assumed the mouse had to take batteries as well. The mouse doesn't take batteties so beware and dont accidently break it trying to find a secret battery compartment. This wasn't a huge deal to me since I have micro chargers everywhere.Other than that, the keyboard and mouse are nice, clean, and light weight. Not extremely quiet as advertised but thats pretty obvious for anyone who clicks away and types up a storm. Keyboards and mice are never silent.Hope this helps.

  It looks like I was in the process of reviewing this and got called away. I liked it at first and then got to where I didn't like it at all.  I went through the trouble of shutting off both the mouse and keyboard and the battery life of each wasn't so good.  IMHO.  The thing is there is no warning to let you know when the battery of either is low they quit working.  The mouse is rechargeable and it is possible to use the power connection if the battery goes, however, for me the cable always seems to prevent me from moving the mouse easily.The keyboard stops working and again no warning.  I don't think the battery life improved by turning it off. Then today the keyboard quit working altogether.  I changed the batteries and I know they are good because they work in the other keyboard I have and don't like much.It seems like I'm always fiddling with this keyboard to get it to do what I want it to do.

",$119.99 ,Corsair,,B. Seward,Tested both K66 and K68,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2018","
  I first fell in love with Cherry MX Reds after purchasing the K66 (No lights). I then tried the K68 (RGB with dust and spill resistance cover) and there is an obvious difference.The actuation force on the K66 felt lighter. The K68 FELT heavier when pressing down. What i remember from the K66 keyboard is the ease of bottoming out the keys and hearing that addicting sound you get from reds. Not with the K68... not pleasing at all. The cover dampens the sound and ruins the experience for any mechanical keyboard enthusiast. According to reviews, the key caps shouldn't be interfering with the rubber cover. It's probably best just to get into the habit of not setting your drink next to the keyboard... and just go with the non spill/dust resistant version.

  First off, the keys are VERY SLICK.  I find typing to have slowed down, because your fingers keep sliding around on the keyboard.  - There are no tactile indicators that you are on the WASD keys.  The F key has a tactile bump to find the home-row if you are typing, but for Gaming, it's needless.  So on one hand, you have a keyboard that's more tuned for general typing, but have keys that are smooth and hard plastic, so your fingers slide all over.Software is completely baffling and had to go to a youtube to figure out how to do profiles.  Software is pretty weak as far as user interface goes.  But not intuitive.Positive note, is that it feels more responsive when playing than my Steelseries.  But unsure if I can get past these keys being slick as snot.

It still works OK but I figured it was time for a new one. The only thing I like better is the K70 has a nice braided cord and this dose not. The lighting is nicer on the K68 RGB model and the keys are easier to read with larger lettering. I definitely do not regret this purchase and glad I ignored the negative reviews.

",$119.99 ,Corsair,,Thomas & Jessii,A good keyboard with a couple caveats... it COULD HAVE been great.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2020","Pros:
- Linear keys have low actuation force needed, which is nice and allows for quick, intentional keystrokes.
- Wrist rest is a good width and is perfectly sloped for the keyboard height. Feels very nice to type on.
- Flexible lighting options with full RGB (if you need that).

Cons:
- Keys are supposed to be ""quite"" but many of them, especially the spacebar, actually have a distinct metallic spring noise and lingers/echos when you release the keys. It's actually really distracting. One can only hope that it subsides after continued use.
- The height/slope of the keyboard, when the kickstands are extended, isn't much height than normal. It's surprisingly flat.
- Row heights are way too similar. Great keyboards have the main 3 rows of keys stepped up in height so that it's easier to find the row that you need easily and adds a bit more separation of the keys, which prevents incorrect inputs. These keys are very similar in height, and it's been a bit of a pain to adjust.
- Key spacing is just a bit too tight. a couple millimeters would make this a much better experience.
- No on-board memory to store your color profile(s).",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Logitech G915 TKL White Tactile Tenkeyless Lightspeed Wireless RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Low Profile Switch Options, LIGHTSYNC RGB, Advanced Wireless and Bluetooth Support






",$229.99 ,Logitech G,,Mike,"Could've been perfect - put off by lack of lit secondary legends, use of micro-USB, and ABS keycaps","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2020","
  [Updated after Logitech fixed their software.  Also added comments on clicky vs tactile and will include my review on both]Went into this with a bit of trepidation because of the low-profile switches.  However, actually found it quite nice to type on.  Also purchased a Drop CTRL at the same time with Halo Trues, and while the feel is obviously totally different, I somewhat prefer the feel of the Logitech key profile and shorter travel.  To be fair, my last mechanical keyboard was a stash of IBM Model M's that I got rid of almost a decade ago, and most of what I've typed on since has been low-profile so I am more used to that now.  Since the key-spacing is still standard, the G915 shouldn't require a ton of adjustment for people used to full size keyboards.That said, this keyboard has some flaws, with the first one being the most significant to me - the secondary legends are not lit.  All the special character keys (like & and *) are simply printed on the keys and do not light.  Since the printing is not high contrast to begin with, this makes them exceptionally difficult to see in the dark.  I have no problem touch typing with the alpha keys, but will glance for the less frequently used special characters, and the lack of lighting is really annoying.  It's also a little confusing for keys where the secondary character is used more commonly than the primary (ex: double quotes, question mark, etc...).For reference, the lighter of the photos was taken with typical indoor lighting and while you can see the legends they don't exactly stand out.  Under dim lighting, much less with the lights out, they're effectively invisible.  This is an especially glaring flaw given plenty of other keyboard manufacturers have figured out a simple solution to this - simply print the secondary legend alongside the primary instead of below it, and let them both light up.Second, this is 2020.  Why in the world did Logitech choose to go with micro-USB instead of USB-C?  Most other new model high end keyboards now have started adopting USB-C.  This was a common complaint on the original G915 as well (along with the lack of lit secondary legends), and it's clear Logitech hasn't learned anything from all of the prior feedback.Third, while the battery life from the lithium battery is great, if I'm spending $220 on a keyboard, I don't want to replace it in a few years if the battery starts losing its capacity.  How many of you have had cell phones or laptops that just don't hold a charge as long as they used to?  If you usually use this in wired mode that may be unlikely (since you're not constantly discharging the battery fully), but it would be better if the battery was replaceable. And, while I might be in the minority for saying so, I'd almost rather it use rechargeable NiMH AA's (just throw a couple of Eneloops in it) than a non-replaceable lithium battery.Finally, I really wish Logitech had went with higher end keycaps.  On a $220 keyboard it isn't outrageous to hope for PBT double-shot keycaps.  While ABS keycaps aren't uncommon, at this price point a lot of wired keyboards are now including PBT double-shot keycaps, which feel more solid, won't show oil shine, and won't have legends wearing out.  This and the lack of shine-through secondary legends would be less of an issue if you could replace the keycaps, but it's virtually impossible to find third party keycaps in this profile (looks similar to Kailh Choc switches but I don't have a Kailh Choc board to try swapping with).  To be fair there's not a large number of mechanical wireless keyboards to begin with, and most of those are also still using ABS keycaps, so you may be stuck with this regardless (when the Keychron K8 eventually comes out, its keycaps will be ABS but are at least OEM profile and can be swapped out).Originally there were issues with the software, but Logitech fixed those with a software update made available on release day.  The new software does recognize the keyboard correctly and let you customize the lighting.  You can also adjust things like how long a period of inactivity before the lighting turns off.  Note that you also need the software to set a default lighting mode (for example, the board defaults to all keys lit the same color and gently rotates between colors - I prefer the color wave, but the board won't remember that without the software, and after inactivity defaults back to the original setting).As for the pluses... As I noted above, it's quite comfortable (for me at least) to type on.  I've apparently come to prefer the light actuation force and short key travel.  The Lightspeed wireless is responsive, simply works (just plug in the dongle - no issues with pairing), and doesn't interfere with my Bluetooth headset, which is a big plus.  If you can get past the unlit secondary legends, the primary legends are attractive and have a very pleasant glow.Build quality is good and the aluminum top panel is attractive and has a decent heft to it.  The bottom is plastic but seems solid and the keyboard doesn't feel like it has any worrisome flex to it.  The plastic tip-out feet do feel a bit cheap, though they still hold the keyboard without shaking.  At this price point wired keyboards are a lot more robust (the Drop CTRL I also purchased has an aluminum upper and lower, and the feet are also solid aluminum), but that's not really an apples-to-apples comparison.If you're looking at both the clicky and tactile versions of this keyboard, both felt good to me to type on.  However, the tactile response on the clicky is sharper and more noticeable.  With these low profile switches the tactile version has relatively little feedback when compared to full size tactile switches.  I can't compare it to the linear version, but If you're coming from a keyboard with a significant tactile response, the tactile version of this keyboard is definitely going to be more subtle in comparison.The clicky version technically clicks both on the downstroke and on the upstroke.  This isn't that noticeable and isn't at all off-putting.  The key does actuate before the click, but it is close enough that it is imperceptible and is unlikely to affect normal typing (to confirm it I had to push the key down as slowly as I possibly could).  The sound is definitely a ""click"", or ""tick"", not a ""clack"".  Subjectively the Kailh click bar based switches are reported to be a bit higher pitched but crisper than ones based on a click jacket design (like Cherry MX Blues).  The last clicky keyboard I owned was an IBM Model M, which isn't really a fair comparison, and this definitely doesn't scratch that itch for me.  However, as noted above, I found the click gave a slightly better tactile response than the non-clicky tactile version.  Alas, while the keyboard is not that loud, it was still a deal breaker for my wife.Unfortunately, the negatives really leave me on the fence with this keyboard.  The Drop CTRL I am also considering is better built, has better keycaps, swappable switches, USB-C, and open source firmware.  If I go with the G915 it will either be because I can't past having an extra wire on my desk (and right now the G915 is probably the best wireless option with backlit keys unless you want to take a chance on a Hexgears Venture) or because I find myself unable to adapt to full height keys anymore after using laptop keyboards for so long.If I had suggestions for Logitech:* Lit secondary legends* USB-C* PBT keycaps* User replaceable battery

I'm so happy and surprised this keyboard can work it! I know it's not meant for gaming but still!! I didnt want to replace it for a gaming keyboard because I love this one so much! The keyboard has held up and I love it. I dont have any problems concerning loud typing? That kind of stuff doesn't bother me but if theres any reviewer who has had this keyboard since 2018, please update your experience too!",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I chose this keyboard because of the slim design and low profile keys. I wanted to wait until I had used it for a while to review it, but this is a great keyboard AND this company provides excellent customer service.  A couple of days after I got it several keys stopped working and I sent a very garbled email (with letters missing from words) to the company and they immediately responded and sent a new keyboard. Of course I was worried that it really was a crappy keyboard and I would need another stye sooner rather than later.However, I am happy to say I love this little silver keyboard. The design, the feel the response is great. If you are thinking about getting one... go for it.

  After trying 3 wireless keyboards and sending them all back for various reasons which included, inconsistent connectivity, no connectivity, extremely poor battery life, etc., I finally found this one and decided to try it. This one cost at least $6 less than the previous 3 keyboards I tried and the build quality is much better. The is a full sized keyboard with a numeric keypad and very solidly built. It is weighty and substantial and the key action is delightful and very quiet. It includes a tiny little receiver/transmitter dongle that you plug into a spare USB port. Mine connected instantly with no problems. Here is no keystroke lag that I can detect. This is my first solar keyboard and I haven’t had it long enough to know how well that charging method works as opposed to using regular batteries; however, because of the excellent build quality of this keyboard, I’m not anticipating any problems. If there is a problem with the solar charging feature I will update this review accordingly. Otherwise, just assume that it is just as awesome as the rest of this keyboard.

The Good:

* Feels solid when resting on your lap
* Keys are comfortable to type on
* It has both a right-side Windows Logo key and an Applications Context menu key (rare)

The bad:
* The space bar should be a bit more wide and the right-side keys should be a little more narrow
* The enter key should be a bit more wide
* There should be a little spacing after each set of 4 function keys

Now, I would normally give it 5 stars, however I'm giving it 3 because the keyboard I got has a malfunctioning right-side control key.

If you buy this keyboard you're essentially throwing money away because you're going to need to buy another keyboard to replace it.

The first month you use this it might seem like an okay keyboard but very quickly you're going to realize it has a problem staying connected. Also if you plug it in to charge anywhere other than your computer that's a disconnection, if you turn it off and on again 50-50 chance it's not going to connect when it comes back on, restart your computer again 50% chance it will not connect. And I've and I've tried changing the wireless receiver that came with it to a Bluetooth one and it has the same problem just as frequently, which means its the actual keyboard itself. And looking online a lot of people have the same problem with Corsair products in general.

This really hit all the checkmarks except for the byom(ouse) which is fine. I bought a 3 meter usb extension cable for my Logitech G502 to reach my lazy worthless lump propped up against a wall of pillows. It reaches just fine and there is more than enough give to accommodate varying relaxing/laying down configurations.The G602 Logitech works fine in a pinch if you're looking for a real wireless/couch/bed computer gaming experience but it's not even close to the G502. I'll probably pick up the Logitech G403 down the line and that looks like it might be perfect wireless combo for this setup. If any of  you have any suggestions for better wireless gaming mouse please leave a reply!This has my ringing endorsement. The thing is sturdy, the keyboard slides in satisfyingly (the locks could use some work), enough space for the mousepad, and the K63 is a solid keyboard. Very thoughtful to consider that this is probably going to be used in some quieter settings. The memory foam bottom of the thing seals the deal - it is extremely comfortable and balances very well.

I was leaning more towards the SOVA because of the option to use a corded mouse, however at the last minute I chose the K63 because of the lack of chords. I don't regret a thing. Going completely cordless was the way to go for me.
Pros:
- I love the way the keys feel. I've only owned one other mechanical keyboard (razer blackwidow) but i prefer these.
- The memory foam bottom makes it feel like you have a simple pillow on your lap
- Keyboard removable from lapboard. I use it both configurations quite often
- The wrist rest on the lapboard and the one that comes to use if you want a normal keyboard do a good job to minimize wrist strain
- Good battery

Cons (personal experiences):
- Mouse pad has enough friction for you to tilt keyboard slightly but only slightly, before mouse falls
- It seem to have issues every now and then with the FN key when it's plugged up and charging
- If you unplug keyboard while computer is off, the keyboard won't connect wirelessly when computer comes back on. You have to plug it back in so it will connect
- I wish it had more color options than blue. But not the biggest deal
- back light for the ""0"" key is defective. It will only light if the keyboard is on it's brightest setting. Also not the biggest deal",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  Yes, it's a little expensive and the touch pad is tiny.  But it functions very well.  Typing is a breeze and very comfortable.  The keys click and clack like you would expect from a normal keyboard, they just don't travel as far.  Spacing is good, I don't find myself hitting the wrong keys anymore than when using a regular keyboard.  I like the material that covers it, I am guessing some type of sueded microfiber.  Very smooth to the touch, and has the added plus of keeping the surface from sliding around in the car if I lay the cover facing down on my seat.  While some people will tell you that the need for the keyboard on the surface is an absolute, I would disagree.  Unless you plan on using the surface for typing reports, essays, etc, on a frequent basis you can pretty much get by without it.  I seldom use it unless I'm sitting at my desk.  Typing emails with the onscreen keyboard is sufficient, much easier than an iPad, filling out web forms, typing URL's etc, the on screen keyboard is fine.  If I didn't like the convenience of having it when I needed it, I would have probably returned it by now and just connected a wireless keyboard and mouse to my surface when ever I'm at my desk, it's a much less expensive option and probably better if you plan on using this as your main computer.  Is it worth $130?  Probably not, but if I'm in tablet mode and get tired of holding my surface, I just flip out the keyboard and go at it.  It IS the perfect companion for the Surface, and whenever I use it, I'm not thinking about the price.

I have a few different ones for different tablets, such as a Kindle Fire and this thing is light years ahead. It is super light. It's almost hard to believe that it houses a functioning keyboard as I have regular covers that weigh more than this thing.

They keyboard is fantastic. It has just enough downpress to feel like a regular keyboard, and in fact it has this jelly like effect when you press it that's weirdly satisfying, but that's just me perhaps. I've tried using it in total darkness, and no problems with it there. It looks fantastic. It's not the quietest keyboard, but it's no louder than any regular one I've used.

The trackpad is surprisingly good despite its small size. I've had no problems dragging or selecting stuff all over the screen. And it gives off just enough friction, so that you know you have control of the cursor.

Pros
- Super lightweight
- Backlit keyboard
- Good trackpad friction
- Bouncy keypresses

Cons
- The pricing is a bit high
- The material makes the black cover look more grayish than anything

This all changed whenever I pulled it out of the mail and used it fort the first time. Typing is great, the key caps have an impossibly long travel distance for such a small keyboard and the keys have a satisfying *click* to them. The backlight is great for use in the dark, which you can change the brightness on (I just keep it all the way up anyways.) The track pad is smooth and just large enough where I can use it to navigate around with ease.

However, I don't like the uneven lighting of the backlight, as some keys appear brighter than others. I also don't like choice of hotkeys, why did Microsoft give us a way to play/pause the media, but no hotkey for skip/repeat? Who uses insert? I also don't like the flimsiness of the touchpad, which feels as though it'll snap if I click too hard.

Logitech Media Combo MK200 Full-Size Keyboard and High-Definition Optical Mouse






",$22.98 ,Logitech,NULL,Mitty Walters - Author,Excellent quality for the price! WORKS FOR APPLE/MAC!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2017","I'm an old school Mac guy, but avoid Apple peripherals (external hard drives, keyboards, wifi, etc) wherever possible. Not just because they're often insanely overpriced, but also because when Apple steps out of its core competency, quality takes a beating.

Especially keyboards! Them puppies are as pretty as can be, but more fragile than D Trump's ego. One time a single drop of sweat rolled off my forehead and landed on my keyboard. The whole thing short circuited, sirens went off, and the ghost of Steve Jobs reached thru the screen and began rifling thru my pockets for $200 bucks.

Anyway, this keyboard is great. The keys are light to the touch, responsive, do as told. I'm a fast typer, this keyboard does not slow me down. As a writer, I prefer keyboards/mice that plug in so that I don't lose momentum by being forced to go searching for batteries, right in the middle of a hot streak.

Haven't tried the mouse yet, plan to keep it as a spare.

This keyboard is not fancy, but it's cheap, works well, and does the trick. I also have the Logitech K120 and have been using it for years on another Mac with zero issues. The K120 is even cheaper, but it lacks the media buttons on top (volume up, volume down, etc). That's kind of annoying, hence the reason I bumped up to K200 this time.

FOR APPLE USERS:
Yes, the MK200 will work for you... even the volume buttons. When you plug it in the first time, a message will appear on the screen saying your computer needs some help recognizing it. All you have to do is press the buttons it asks you to press and then you can use it. Quick and easy!

If you want the modifier buttons on the MK200 to work exactly as your old keyboard, you will have to swap the positions of the Command and Option keys.

To do that:
1. Open ""System Preferences""
2. Click ""Keyboard""
3. Click ""Modifier Keys""
4. Change (see attached screenshot):
---- Option Key to Command
---- Command Key to Option

After that, all your quick key shortcuts will work as they did on your Apple keyboard.

Hope that helps!

  This combo has a nice design.  The keyboard doesn't mess with tradition, putting all keys where they belong (and the calculator button's a nice touch).  The mouse is a proper size/height and has a good scroll wheel.  Tactile satisfaction is good, and $20 is fair.But I've bought THREE of these MK200 combos over the past year, and each had a major flaw.  On the first combo, the keyboard's spacebar was wonky (it only worked when pressed in a certain spot).  On the second, the mouse wheel was stiff and imprecise.  So I exchanged it for this third combo that was fine at first, but now three months in, the keyboard is glitching up strangely.  When I press Shift + a letter key, one of the two just doesn't register sometimes, causing frequent typos.  The number pad's Enter key also cuts in and out.If my math is correct, 3 out of 3 products konking out calculates to a failure rate of 100%.  Worse, Logitech's dishonest customer service tries extremely hard to not honor the warranty.  They didn't honor mine, despite my proof of purchase and being well within the warranty period.Avoid this product and avoid this company.

It is basically the exact same size and dimensions and layout as the keyboard on my 14"" laptop, except it is missing dedicated page-up/page-down buttons and some of the function keys are different.

  I've purchased several items from iclever in the past & always been very pleased, although I did purchase a similar wireless keyboard several months ago (different model) which looked just as good as this one, but had an issue with the keys not always registering when you were typing and therefore quite a few words were missing letters! (I'm one of those people who never had any formal typing classes, and therefore need to look at the keyboard the entire time I'm typing, so, if the keyboard doesn't work like it should when I get finished I have an indecipherable mess! lol).

",$35.99 ,IClever,,Mad Gremlin,"Security: the reason I replaced a 2.4 ghz ""unified"" wireless keyboard with this...","Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2019","I live in a crowded city in a large apartment building.

Recently, I read an article about 2.4 Ghz wireless systems that was of particular interest, as I used a wireless keyboard with a ""unifying"" USB dongle for rx/tx. I bought it for the convenience, plus it recharged using solar. But this article showed how easily hackers can exploit these wireless systems with a program for linux systems - with very little effort, they stealthily hijacked the computer through that dongle.

For years, I had also used Apple's magic trackpad, which operates using bluetooth. I spent a few hours researching the differences in security between 2.4 ghz wireless keyboards that use a dongle and bluetooth. Although it is possible to gain access through bluetooth, it is a difficult, involved process that requires time and proximity to device, whereas someone can exploit a 2.4 Ghz system with ease.

There are actually three ways a computer can be hijacked through the USB dongle. One of the largest manufacturers of these systems, fully aware of the issue, issued a firmware patch and updated their newest firmware to address only one of the three, as securing their system would mean a number of legacy products would not be able to connect - so they have no plans to make it safer. Because I live in an apartment, eliminating cables and clutter is huge. At the same time, so is the security of my home network. Which led me to this keyboard.

Three days into using iClever's more secure system, I am happy with the purchase. Out of the box, I was concerned it would feel like junk to use - it was so very light! But once I started, it felt on par with the old-fashioned original Apple keyboard that came with the computer. The scissor keys give enough play that it feels natural, and I like that kind of responsiveness. My old wireless keyboard worked well, but would make errors caused by the design of the keyboard instead of my typing. In stark contrast, this iClever keyboard lets me type faster and more accurately.

iClever also offers a more compact version that is strictly bluetooth, instead of a combination with 2.4 ghz radio and bluetooth like this. I chose this one because it was full-sized, and I use control keys often. To make matters better, I have two computers that are often used simultaneously for work. Because this keyboard can connect to two BT sources, this slim, lightweight solution replaces two keyboards. Second, even though I don't expect to use the 2.4 Ghz radio connection regularly, I can see a number of situations where I may use the dongle for a quick connection, or let a guest use it.

The only thing I cannot speak to is durability. I hate creating waste - especially electronic. Its my hope that iClever designs and manufactures their keyboards so regular wear and tear gives a good 5 years of use.

The only possible downside is the rechargeable battery in a sealed case, so if you forget to plug it in after a day of work you can't just slap freshies in. Or if you need to pull a 14-hour work marathon.

Give me a few months to see how well this unit holds up. If this hasn't been updated in six months, it means things are just swell.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

If you don’t use the film, you can hear your keystrokes, so it’s up to your preference.

Like I said, the keyboard is REALLY thin so there isn’t much wrist support. It’s slightly inclined at the back where the keyboard is molded. The bottom has little rubber pieces so the keyboard doesn’t move around on your desk. It stays securely in place.

The mouse is also really thin. Very sensitive, it will take some getting used to. It’s super quiet and the clicks feel solid, no lag.

West,Slim keyboard/mouse combo with nifty recharging feature,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2019","Full disclosure: I have been compensated by Jelly Comb for the cost of the keyboard in exchange for this review. I have had this item for just about one week at the time pf this writing. That said, the following thoughts are mine and mine alone.

This is a nicer-than-average keyboard and mouse combo, with one key difference. Both the keyboard and mouse are rechargeable. No more chewing through pair after pair of AA batteries for the minor luxury of having a wireless keyboard. As an environmentally-conscious consumer, this brings a swell of joy to my heart. I often use Apple's aluminum bluetooth keyboard at work, and the fact that it is not rechargeable now seems ludicrous. Every wireless keyboard should adopt this feature now.

The build quality of keyboard portion of this combo is nice, but feels slightly below premium. You'd never mistake this for a fancy Apple or Microsoft Surface keyboard, but it's light-years ahead of the HP Premium keyboard that came with my home PC. The action of the keys is short, and provide a slight click which feels great to my fingers. The keys are not as clicky or satisfying as a true mechanical keyboard, but provide more feedback than Apple's aluminum offering.

When it comes to the mouse, I have mixed feelings. The mouse is definitely low-profile. It's the flattest mouse I have ever used. It also feels just slightly smaller-than-average, and sits oddly in my hand. Not bad or uncomfortable, just odd. This is probably one of those things that I will adapt to over time, but for right now, it's definitely the thing about this mouse that I like the least. The out-of-the box pointer speed was also a little fast for my taste, but lowering the pointer one notch in the Windows 10 mouse settings was all it took to have absolutely perfect mouse control. The mouse buttons click well and the scroll wheel does an admirable job. Overall, it's a good mouse with an odd shape.

TL;DR
This is a good keyboard and mouse combo with a great recharging feature.

Pros:
• Dead-easy setup
• Nice feeling, responsive keyboard
• No more dead batteries
• Affordable

Cons:
• Low-profile mouse feels odd in my hand",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

EPOMAKER SKYLOONG SK61 61 Keys Hot Swappable Mechanical Keyboard with RGB Backlit, NKRO, IP6X Waterproof, Type-C Cable for Win/Mac/Gaming (Gateron Optical Brown, Grey)






",$65.00 ,EPOMAKER,Gaming,Grace,Budget board for gamers who want to try out different switches,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2020","I bought this board mainly because I was curious for its hot swappable feature without expecting too much from it, so here's my honest review:

The keyboard comes in regular box that says SKYLONG accross in silver letters with no hints of expressing quality. The board comes with a few accessories including a key cap puller, a switch puller, a good quality braided USB C cable and 3 extra key caps (control, options, command). An additional pouch or dust cover would have been nice to have but considering the price I am not complaining.

The build quality of the keyboard is OK. The housing is made of plastic and feel rather cheap with barely any dampening material. Also the back plate feels of subpar quality could benefit from dampening material. The switches I chose were Gateron Black and these switches are very smooth and have 60 grams of actuation force which for gaming and typing I prefer over the Gateron Reds or Brown so no complains about the switches.

Build quality of the keycaps included remind me of those keycap sets that are YMDK branded. They are low profile and feel hollow. Some of the keycaps showed unfinished rough edges but I was only able to confirm that by pulling them out and inspecting them closely. I will add that I tried using a Matt3o keycap set on this and it improved the overall typing experience.

The stabilizers don't feel premium but also don't feel cheap. The spacebar barely has any rattle (from my experience the other Magiforce keyboards had far worse stabs)

LEDs are not bright at all and at full brightness they even seem dimmed but this could be a good sitaution for people who don't want bright RGB lights spewing out of their keyboard. There are 5 LED modes but none of them are appealing to me so I just left the stock settings and ignored playing around with the other modes.

The FN keys are all listed on the manual and it has the typical FN key options you may find in most compact sized keyboards

In conclusion to me the selling point of this board is the hot swappable switches. I think this board is perfect for gamers or students who are on a budget and are curious to find the perfect switch for gaming. We are finally in the era where hot swappable keyboards can be very affordable",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$65.00 ,EPOMAKER,Gaming,Dana,I shouldn't have worried! BEST. BOARD. EVER!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020","This was a risky purchase for me... RGB lighting is usually tacky looking to me, I thought I'd miss the arrow and function keys, and optical switches are supposed to be way worse than regular mechanical switches. RIGHT?

WOW though!! There was no need to worry!! I absolutely love everything about this board! I love it so much I might film, respring, and lube this baby up to make it feel like a TOTL board.

I don't miss the arrow or function keys at all, it's so cute and small and feels so good that this is an easy trade off. Also, the colors of the keys and the feeling of the PBT keys is just fantastic! I got the black-key version and it's both bold and subdued at the same time somehow.. like a maseati, it's just sleek and you can almost glance over it but as soon as you look closer it screams awesomeness at the same time as practicality. This could easily be an office keyboard as well as a gaming/battlestation keeb. And, not only that, but the RGB on this is GORGEOUS! It's not overly bright, but the colors have crisp saturation so (even though I thought when buying it I'd just turn the lighting off...) I LOVE THE RGB. Hahaha

Using this for gaming is AMAZING. The optical switches are legit noticeably faster than traditional mech switches. The input time on it (12-20ms faster..doesn't seem like much) is actually noticeable and I love how instantaneous my movements feel now. It's like going from a 60fps to 144hz monitor!

The value of this is ridiculous. I bought it just for the fact that it's hotswappable at only $65. INSANE. I do find that the red's a bit fast for my meatsticks, I want a tad bit more pressure in the springs.. SOOO, since it's hotswappable, I could literally just buy a $15 60pack of Gat-Blacks and swap these switches out..but, honestly, the red's pretty great for gaming and the board's so inexpensive that I might simply buy another one in black to use when I'm typing more instead of gaming.

Last thing too, I was worried that with it being an inexpensive board with hotswap, inexpensive switches, and inexpensive caps, the keys would feel wobbly... well NOT AT ALL. This is not my first mechanical board (not even close) and this one's about tied as the most well-seated clicks that I've had.

OPTICAL IS THE NEW WAY TO GO!!!! I am SO GLAD I bought this board out!!!!!

  I have always had an interest in learning to play the piano, but I was never able to take conventional lessons because of a lack of time (and money).  After looking around for a comprehensive beginner's course, I decided to give this DVD lesson a chance, and I am glad I did.  It is very thorough and is an excellent starting point for those wishing to learn the basics of piano playing.  I was taught the proper finger positions along with some beginner scales, and all were introduced in a manner that I could understand - which was vital since I have had no sort of training beforehand. In fact, I can now play ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" on the piano!  For the price, I think that the quality of this video is amazing, and the length is perfect to keep you engaged in the lessons.

  While you can learn from this DVD it could be much better. The DVD skips in several spots and the earlier footage appears to be done while the camera is hand held. DVD provides a basic understanding of the piano, teaches a few simple songs, and a few chords. The content is just okay. It's difficult to apply the lessons unless you can watch while sitting in front of the keyboard which in my opinion makes an instruction book a bit more useful. Excellent idea but the technology limits capability. If the content was transferable to a phone or tablet so that it could sit on the keyboard during practice I might have given it a higher rating. Unlike the piano, DVD is nearing its end of life and this lesson format may already be obsolete. I'd recommend looking at a more up to date teaching medium.

Easy to follow lessons with a great instructor!

  I bought this for my 11 yo bc he has been wanting to try the PC style of gaming with his PS4 and a regular smart tv & not a monitor or actual computer. In our case this bundle has been pretty amazing the first few hours. He is adapting to play Fortnite and loves the red dragon bundle with the red and black. Everything has been very useful. The PS4 knew automatically the keyboard and mouse were hooked up and most of the controls were shown on the game display just as they would with a PS4 controller. The only thing we can’t figure out is how to change the lights bc he doesn’t like the rainbow lol. But the feel and features of the keyboard, mouse, headset and mousepad are very impressive for the price.

Here is why I gave it ONE STAR! After downloading it, they said to use WIN.RAR to open it. Ok fine, but the kicker is that in order to open it with WIN.RAR you have to purchase it for $22.00. NOT!

",$49.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,,"Great value, some short cuts (can't save configuration)","Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2019","
  So I've been building a gaming setup at home.  I have bought and upgraded a Dell Inspiron 7577 (same as G5's now) over the past year, including buying a 120Hz LED panel upgrade (see review).  I recently bought a MSI 32"" curved gaming monitor and now wanted to complete the setup with a wired keyboard and mouse.I'm a casual gamer and didn't really want to spend a lot for a setup.  Originally, I was looking at keyboards alone for about $100 but then I decided to see if I could find a combo for cheap but well rated.  I found this set and jumped at the chance.  It was quite a bit cheaper than I had expected to pay but it also included a headset.  Initial impressions were very positive.  Product was packaged in a great box with each part individually segmented.  No issues with damage, very nice product packaging, definitely not a fly by night company with made in china generic box packaging.So my comments are related to the cost that I paid.  I'm not going to expect the world of what I got b/c I know I didn't pay much at all.  Keyboard is pretty nice feel.  It of course is not mechanical with the clicking but though I would like that I was not willing to spend for it.  Graphics are pretty classy and go with the red dragon I have for the MSI gaming monitor.  The one major miss is there is no software for the keyboard and whatever customizations you set are lost the minute you reboot.  LIke if you want a red keyboard all the time, you have to set it every time you start your computer, your laptop up.Mouse is similarly good.  Default resolution is much higher than my normal office mouse so I had to adjust so that I could move the mouse at a speed I was used to.  The headphones also look pretty understated but the sound quality is definitely meh.  Again, I'm fine with everything.  I have a gamer setup for when I occassionally want to play games.  It is not bad with the branding and graphics whereas there were many keyboards/mice that looked cheap or had horrid fonts/graphics.  Can't speak to reliability and performance but will add that after a few months of gaming.

  For a full-sized keyboard this one is great and doesn't take up a lot of space on my desk AND it is probably the thinnest keyboard that I have ever owned! I love how the keys feel when I am typing on it. You can tell that it is made from quality material and not some cheap plastic material. It also does not produce a very loud clickity-clackity sound like you would hear with most mechanical keyboards. When pressing the keys you'll notice a soft little chicklet sound, which I find to be very satisfying. The sound it produces, I'd say, is most similar to a mac laptop's built-in keyboard. When pressing the keys the responsiveness is flawless and very rapid as it should be.I try to keep my desk very tidy so I prefer wireless devices over wired. I am happy that this keyboard is not only wireless but it is also rechargeable so I won't ever need to worry about replacing batteries. So far, I have noticed that the battery life is pretty outstanding. That is a huge plus for me since I am always using my computer for both work and school. Overall I am very pleased with the quality of this keyboard and for having paid under $30 for it, I'd say it is a great keyboard for the price. You won't be disappointed.

  The first thing about this is that the keyboard is a pretty nice gray metal which is nice if you want a nice clean keyboard.. The next thing is that you do not need to install any new batteries into this as it come with a battery built in which is great. It does use a dongle to connect giving pretty good response time. This keyboard looks like a mac keyboard, it has the same layout a standard PC keyboard. It also is not the best keyboard to use if you are trying to troubleshoot a mac unfortunately as it does not connect to the mac during boot up which is unfortunate. The keyboard response is pretty nice and built like a mac keyboard. It does however get dirty and show visible oils from your hands when you type over a long period of time. There is not any noticeable lag and I am able to type well with this keyboard. The keys feel okay. I would say compared to an original mac keyboard, it definitely feels cheaper. What I like about this is that you can recharge it and there are LED light indicators to show things like the cap lock and a power indicator to show if you need to recharge your device. It also has an on and off button so you are able to turn the device off easily when not in use. You can pair this to pretty much all operating systems from macs to android devices. The keyboard works pretty well. The one down side is that it does us a standard micro USB to charge it and not a type c so you may have a harder time plugging this into say a macbook pro. The device works for quite sometimes before you need to recharge it again. I had it working for several days before the light indicator came on. It only takes up to about five hours or so to fully charge. The keys are gray so be careful when leaving this out in the sun as you are probably only going to get a light color after awhile on top of your finger print. You can use this for gaming but it is not the best feel. Overall this keyboard is a good keyboard. It allows you to connect one devices and has a pretty nice distance as well. I would also say that it be nice to be able to have a spot for the USB dongle on the actual keyboard. I was able to go about fifteen or so feet before it started having issues with connectivity. It feels cheaper than a mac keyboard but works well none the less.

Didn't feel stiff at all as some others were reporting. Additional function keys serve their purpose.Item loses a star (was considering two) for a really, really disappointing mouse. Responsiveness was considerably delayed; experienced a full second of lag from the depression of the scroll wheel to an actual on-screen response.

It feels very sturdy and the keys function well for the most part. It does take a little bit to get used to them, likely because of the how little you have to push the letter down.

However, I can't give this keyboard and mouse combo a higher rating than 2 stars because the mouse was absolutely terrible. It's very lightweight, it feels cheap, and the overall shape is awkward to grip. The functionality has also been subpar, especially the vertical scrolling wheel. It is not smooth at all and gave me a headache because of how choppy the movement was as I was reading. I've tried to adjust my mouse settings at first, but nothing changed the choppiness; it seems to actually be an issue with the mouse wheel.

Also tested successfully with a friend's Samsung Galaxy Note 8, also with USB-C.  If you have an older USB port Android smartphone, you will need a different adapter than above, and no guarantee this setup will work with a phone that is not OTG.

To get it to work, simply plug the viveComb keyboard, USB-A provided cable, and adapter above bought separately together and all that into the smartphone's USB-C charging port.  When my LG smartphone recognized the keyboard as another keyboard connected, selected the USB option 'Power Supply, charge the connected device', also flip the power toggle switch from Off to On on this vive Comb physical keyboard.  The keyboard above its mouse with click buttons, a red status light stays on and a blue one stays on for a second when the power toggle switch is turned On.  Check your Google Settings, Language and Input, and you will see you have a Sino Wealth USB Physical Keyboard connected.  You are then ready to go.

Have tested this keyboard so far with the following Google Android apps - Chrome browser, my email app, text messaging, and a notepad app   If much typing to do, lot faster with this physical keyboard than with your phone's on screen keyboard, especially more so if have larger than average finger tips.   Also, at least with my LG phone, have dual keyboard/mouse keyboard connectivity, even interchangeable back and forth while typing the same message, so typing is faster with the physical keyboard, but perhaps with mouse and click functions may be quicker to do using your smartphone's on screen options.

The viveComb foldable physical keyboard with USB keyboard cable in a box that is 6.7 inches by 4.2 inches by 1.8 inches (has compartment for cable) so easy to travel with on the go. The keyboard itself folded measures 6.0 inches x 3.8 inches by 0.6 inches, so yes could fit in a large pants pocket, but now looking for a suitable protective case of the right size and not too thick from Amazon or elsewhere. The keyboard appears well made, and so far no problem typing on it.

I am SO excited this works!!, speeding up my typing on my phone, rather than waiting to get to a PC or laptop to do any extensive typing.  I had emailed the vive Comb seller prior to buying, which they made no guarantee the USB connectivity would work with a smartphone, but thinking it probably would (offering a full refund if it did not), so decided I would be their guinea pig on this keyboard's USB connectivity with an Android phone with a USB-C OTG port.  So happy this works!!",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  First, this keyboard has poor build quality which I'm willing to ignore considering its price. What I'm not going to ignore is the fact that it uses an ancient version of Bluetooth (specifically 3.0) that is highly vulnerable to attacks and shouldn't be considered acceptable for a portable input device. Bluetooth is not the most secure wireless technology to use anyway, but relying on a 10 year old protocol for a device that's likely to be used in public is pretty dumb. Returned it.

  I bought this keyboard due to its thin and lightweight design, in hopes of using it to connect to my iPad Pro. It's unique design makes it a bit unusual to use at first, thanks to both the split design and the angle at which you type at with it. After a few minutes though the process is effortless. The keyboard is very responsive while typing, and the keys seem to have a good travel distance. Connecting it to my tablet was a breeze, and took less than 30 seconds after reading the instructions. The keyboard itself is very thin, and adds virtually no added weight not bulk to anything you use to carry it in. The outer material of the keyboard feels very soft, and not like the typical plastic that these types of things tend to be made of. All in all, it's a good keyboard with few downsides, and I've been enjoying it so far.

",$28.99 ,BlueFinger,,Matt,Great deal for the price,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2017","
  First off, I think it is ridiculous that there are a lot of people on here complaining about this keyboard and mouse. For this intricate of a design, plus the backlighting and lit keys, not to mention the cheap price, no one should be complaining. you want a $150 mouse and keyboard set? go buy one. In my opinion, this is an awesome keyboard and mouse. The colors/lighting are awesome, and it doesn't have that ""cheap"" feel to me. The mouse click is so quiet, I cant even tell if it clicks. the keyboard is much quieter than the expensive Logitech wireless set it just replaced. I have had no issues so far, this company did a great job for a ""budget-minded"" gaming bundle. With that said, there are a few little things that are slightly annoying, but for the awesome product and price, I cannot dock any stars. The keyboard/mouse bundle did not come with any instructions, and I cannot find a company website. If you make a product like this, especially with different functions/colors, PLEASE at least print up a manual showing how to change colors and ghosting on the keyboard and mouse. I can probably turn off the ghosting on the mouse, but do not know how to. That is all, great product for the price. just need instructions.

",$28.99 ,BlueFinger,,J. Foster,Reasonably good product that lasted about 3 years,"Reviewed in the United States on May 14, 2020","
  Surprised to look up my order and find that I ordered this three years ago.  Didn't seem like that long ago.  I was coming back to post a review since the mouse now needs to be replaced.  A few months ago, I noticed the left mouse button not actually registering the clicks to the computer.  You can feel the button clicking physically, but the mouse never actually sent the click command to the PC.  Over time that has gotten worse and it's now often enough that I'm replacing the mouse.The keyboard is still working fine after three years of using it daily for working and gaming.  The printing started coming off the most commonly used letters/buttons after just a few months and now many buttons are just illuminated circles where my fingers have repeatedly pressed them.  The buttons are not silent and you can hear a noticeable sound every time a button is pressed, so this would not be a good choice for a quiet office or gaming environment where you want near silence to be able to hear gaming sounds clearly.Other than those issues, the set has been fine.  Since the mouse lasted three years and the keyboard is still going, I give it 4 stars overall.

  This product arrived yesterday, I have been using it for 24 hours straight due to the work I had to complete with it and it has not failed me yet, I use it to edit YouTube videos and of course game, the lights are great they are not blinding but they do make the keyboard look visually stunning in low light scenarios (most of the time I was using it the room was dark) it has small things that are very nice about it such as the mouse matching patterns and lights with the keyboard. I also gamed with it a decent amount and for FPS it’s awesome I mean the haven’t found a thing wrong with it ; however, I also played League Of Legends with it and for those of you who know you hold down the space bar in order to keep your camera locked on the character. While doing this the camera would randomly unlock and I noticed it it because I was not holding the space bar down with enough force causing it not to register, this wasn’t a problem after I discovered what I was doing wrong. It is notable though. Other than that one small thing it is an amazing product I have switched from my razor products to this for the time being to durability test it. The only suggestion I have is when you first open it fold the mouse pad the opposite direction it was folded and place something heavy on it the mousepad is folded for shipping and it puts a small bit annoying crease in the pad! Also the mouse, this company decided to go the opposite direction when it comes to trends. Most companies such as Logitech, razer, etc try to get an extremely clicky sound and feel from everything they produce, this mouse does not mimic that it actually produces a lower click sound that is softer but still noticeable and I love it seeing as how I do most of my work while it’s night it is not a problem, it also keeps from waking others!! 10/10 would recommend!!

VELOCIFIRE TKL02 Mechanical Keyboard TKL 87 Key Tenkeyless Ergonomic with Brown Switches, and White LED Backlit for Copywriters, Typists and Programmers






",$34.99 ,VELOCIFIRE,Ergonomic,David,"For its price, this keyboard has a lot going for it.","Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2018","
  It uses Outemu Brown switches, which means this is a mechanical keyboard instead of a membrane.  Unfortunately I noticed that some keys are slightly stiffer then others, which is a bit disorienting.  Official Cherry MX switches go though a lot of testing to prevent this from happening.  Luckily its not a huge deal-breaker to me so it only gets -1 review star for this.Other then that, its a really nice keyboard.  It has a hefty metal feel so it and good rubber pads on its feet so it doesn't slide around, and it has double shot keycaps which means the keys feel solid and the lettering shouldn't melt/scratch off anytime soon.  It has a nicely long cable,  and it has some lighting effects.  Keys don't wiggle too much, its easy to clean,  and I like the size of its enter bar and backspace buttons.A gamer switching from membrane keyboards to switches like these will likely notice a difference in response times.  At first because the trigger isn't at the bottom of the keystroke keys timing may be a bit early, but after that the tactile bump makes it better for getting timings down.  Even if you are not a gamer and are just typing a paper, the feeling seems to help reduce the number of errors I make just by knowing for sure when a key-press goes though instead of the mushy feeling you get on a membrane.Its missing premium things like a braided cable and RGB, but the price here makes it a winner at about a third of what premium mechanical keyboards cost.  Vs others in its price range the brown switches (quieter), not too wobbly keys, rubber feat, and hefty feel make it stand out.

  This is my first mechanical keyboard, purchased to use for typing in an office environment.The keys are a definitely louder than a membrane keyboard (duh), but not too bad with all the other background noise going on.  Sometimes, they do have that slight  ""pinging"" noise that other reviews have noted, but in order to produce it I need to exert A LOT of force on the keys and my surroundings need to be completely quiet... so... its not an issue at all :)The keyboard itself is very sturdy and very heavy.  It doesn't slide around my desk like my old crappy Dell keyboard, and that is great.  Not having a numberpad is also appreciated, leaving a good amount more room to use the mouse.I should note that the blue-teal lighting effects are not very bright, and that there are other mechanical keyboards out there at a similar price point that do offer RGB, but neither or these points bother me.  The keyboard does remember your lighting presets when unplugged or when the computer is restarted, so that's a plus!-UPDATE 11/29/2018-Updating it to a full 5 stars now.

At around $30, this fit the bill perfectly and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

I have tried Cherry MX Brown keyboards in the past and found that I would occasionally hit keys on accident from just the weight of my fingers resting on the keys, but I have not had that issue with this keyboard--the actuation force on these switches seem to be a touch heavier. My only minor complaint would be that this keyboard is fairly loud for ""brown"" switches. I tried adding o-rings to the key caps but found that it just added mushiness without reducing sound much (whereas they quieted down my blue keyboard quite a bit). It doesn't bother me, but something to keep in mind if you are in a particularly sound-sensitive environment.

As some others have noted, a few of the switches seem to be a little inconsistent and some of the key caps feel a little wobbly, but I don't really notice it during day-to-day typing.

So I’ve been needing a new keyboard since like 2013 (when I got my computer and the keyboard it came with) I’ve been slowly adding pink into my set up and this was basically perfect. I don’t do PC gaming just mainly because I don’t have the computer for it, with that being said that is why I chose THIS exact mouse and keyboard.

It is not mechanical and I don’t need it to be, mechanical keyboards are more expensive for a reason. I just wanted a cute setup vs paying that Razr price for basically the same look.

The directions never stated how to change the color on the keyboard only to adjust the brightness and mode (solid or more of a pulse/breathing sort of flash) press FN+TAB to change the keyboard colors from blue, clear, orange, pink etc. to change the brightness or effect press FN+ESC.

The mouse was constantly flashing through different colors until I pressed DPI on the mouse and the side button until I chose a solid color I wanted vs rainbow.

The keyboard is solid color only, doesn’t flash different colors like the mouse or a rainbow gradient like other brands so if that’s a make or break for you there you go.

I am VERY happy with my purchase. I personally think this is a STEAL for price paid. I have a windows 10 Lenovo and I just plugged into the USB in back and it worked 100% no problems.

The mouse only flashes between green and red with the occasional yellow now since plugging it into my new PC which is a windows 10 cyberpower and now it just cycles 2 colors and wont change to anything else which is a real bummer honestly So my original review was 5 stars but ive taken it down to 4 stars due to only owning it for 5 months and it doesnt function correctly when it comes to lights. The mouse is still working just fine at the moment and does what its supposed to do but I mainly got this for the RGB and now its missing blue, pink, clear, purple and cyan....",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The keyboard has shortcut buttons and larger keys than some other keyboards, which works great with my arthritis 😊 Plus the set was super cheap in comparison to all the others!Overall, I’m very pleased with this set, it’s very entertaining and soothing while working long hours in front of the computer and then gaming!

The mouse very minimalistic with soft and absolutely silent clicks - exactly what I have been looking for. It can also be charged like the keyboard via microUSB which is a huge plus over other similarly-priced options. Other reviewers have noted trouble with the right click mouse button, but I have not.To those wondering like I was, this set works on BOTH Windows and Mac even though the description says Windows only.

",$30.99 ,,,workingmusician,"Good build quality, fast keys","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2019","I'm not a gamer, but I'm a fast typist and I like/need a keyboard with short keystroke that rebounds quickly. I also like the absence of a 10-key pad so I don't have to reach over it every time I want to mouse. Logitech DiNovo used to be perfect for me but they've been out of production for years and this is the best thing I've found since.

Pros:
+ It has a solid feel, heavy-ish metal case that doesn't slide around like most small keyboards and good key action for fast light typing.
+ It has worked flawlessly since it arrived, though that has only been a few weeks so far.
+ The spacing between the keys is the same as a standard keyboard, so it feels good that way.

Cons:
- The included mouse is to small for me. I'm happy using this keyboard and my previous Logitech mouse although that means 2 USB dongles.
- The keyboard sits too flat for me. I had to stick a couple of rubber feet under it to get the angle I like.
I could wish it was backlit.
- The Home, End, PgUp, PgDn, Insert, PrtScr, Volume Up/Down, Mute, Play/Pause, etc. keys are only accessible as combination keypresses, for example, you have to hold Fn while pressing F6 to mute the volume. I'd rather have a dedicated key for that. If the phone rings I want to mute the computer with a single keypress. Likewise, if I want to select to the end of a line of text, I don't want to have to press 3 keys, Fn+Shift+End. Shift+End should be enough. These are tradeoffs they made to keep the overall keyboard footprint small, and it is indeed very small, so it's not a dealbreaker for me.

I've tried several mini-keyboards for having keystroke action too slow or too deep, being too light and scooting all over the desk, poor wireless connection, etc. This is the first one since the DiNovo that is a keeper. For my needs the Pros far outweigh the Cons.

If I had to buy it again I'd choose the Space Grey instead of the Black so they keys might be a little easier to see with my old eyes in my dimly-lit office.

I'm thinking of getting another one and velcroing it to a lapdesk along with a trackball to control the laptop that drives the living room TV.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$30.99 ,,,Hunter & Amanda,"Simple, beautiful, and reliable","Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2018","Edit: Updating my review after almost one year of use (5 stars -> 4 stars). It's been an excellent, low-maintenance keyboard this whole time, but after about a year a couple of the keys (especially M) stopped being reliable. I may need to take it apart to see what I can do, but it'd be nice if the thing were somewhat more sturdy. That said, one year of good service to a computer programmer is pretty solid regardless, so four stars instead of five.

Previous review:

I use this keyboard and mouse daily for work and I waited a week before writing this review.

They look great with a modern desk and equipment. The keyboard layout maps very closely to my Macbook pro, but has better depth, spring response, and overall feel. It's not loud but it's clear whether or not you've pressed a key. The mouse tracks well and, despite its lightness, doesn't feel cheap. I never charged them and they've been running 8 hours/day since I opened the box with whatever charge they came with. They're very smart about going to sleep to save power, but they wake up instantly. I have had zero problems waking my Macbook by pressing enter, for example, which has been an issue with previous wireless keyboards.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$30.99 ,,,Ron,"wireless, rechargeable, low cost, compact: WOW","Reviewed in the United States on March 20, 2019","
  I purchased this keyboard, because it is wireless and does not have a number pad, which makes the keyboard a full sized qwerty keyboard, but very compact.  The special keys and function keys are very well organized and utilized.  Moreover, its rechargeable with a provided USB cable, and even though the keyboard is thin, the keys give a firm tactile response.  The case feels like it is well made.  My only concern is the ON/OFF switch.  It is super tiny, located on the bottom of the keyboard, while the temporary turn on LED indicator is on the top side.Unlike the keyboard, the mouse has an easy to use and labeled ON/OFF switch.  It too is rechargeable.  The case is too flat for me.  I prefer to rest the palm of my hand on a more rounded mouse case.  Furthermore, there are only thin edges on each side of the case for holding the mouse.  It works very well as a pointing device and the buttons give a definitive click response, but the case could be better.I recommend this wireless, plug and play, and rechargeable keyboard/mouse combination, especially for it low cost.

  I am really happy with this instrument,  and surprised at the quality of the sound and the price. I've always liked Yamaha products, tuner/amplifiers, guitars,  and now keyboards.  It's been awhile since I've bought anything,  so was a little concerned whether the quality was still there. I'm happy to say the quality is sti.ll there!This device has many diff sounds and options, but all I really wanted was a piano type keyboard,  and this one fills the bill. The keys are full size, the touch is fine, and it really sounds like a piano.  I fiddled with a cpl other optional sounds, guitar, voice (chorale, really pretty), I  guess Grand Piano is the default.  I'm not an expert, I  can't address what qualities make a good piano good, but for my beginning needs and questionable talent this keyboard is just right. It's light enough that I can move it around, set it on a coffee table ( it has soft pads, won't scratch anything) or whatever; just plug it in and play. 61(full size) keys is plenty for me, and makes the size good for serious work while still being portable. Tones gradually fade if you keep the keys depressed, like a piano, or stop abruptly if you raise up your fingers. I believe a Sustain pedal is available, plus a stand if you need one (I don't). I haven't hooked it up to any other devices, spkrs or whatever,  but the sound from the instrument is better than I  expected and all I need for now...and plenty loud enough; I  just had it on about 1/4 volume.  I bought it to replace a Casio I had yrs ago, and every thing about this keyboard is better than my old Casio, and $50 less in price(the Casio did have a stand, and no complaints). It may not be a professional type electric piano, but it's def not a toy. I'm very happy with this purchase!

",,,,Joshua Jansen,Seems pretty decent (short ownership),"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2020","Only just got this (which is a left-hand keyboard) a few days ago. Using it, off to the left side of my main keyboard which I can now keep in one place for typing, feels completely natural. I remapped my map and autorun keys to left-hand for faster access.

The wrist-rest slope is the same non-reinforced ABS of the rest of the case and indeed any keyboard, and is much more comfortable to use than a standard keyboard design.

I cannot yet speak to the long-term quality of the component, but it feels no different from any other generic dome switch keyboard. Since it's kind of a specialty construction, I imagine it'll last slightly longer than a normal generic keyboard.

My main complaint about the device is the spacebar fragment; its cross-section is the same geometry as the rest of the alphanumeric and function keys, when it would've been just as easy and reasonable to use the cross section of the adjacent Alt FN and Ctrl keys. The result is a sharp edge on the corner. Maybe that explains the price? Whatever the case, it's not actually bad and I don't mind actuating space from the corner of a key (yet, maybe longer use will change that).

If you can get this for $20, jump at it. Well worth it at that price.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

Soft rubber feel on wrist rest area and very intuitive RGB controls with backlighting only suffering on outer G Keys. love the diamond tread texture on the W,A,S,D with the W having a ""Ramp"" at the top of the key that is perfect. Plug and play, currently using mine on my XBOX One.

Improvements: I would like to see the addition of the windows key. This could easily be relocated to a non essential location but would allow menu navigation, as well as secondary binding on WASD as arrows keys in their respective directions as a shift, ctrl or alt function. Again adding menu navigation that does not require key binding.

Cons: -slight twang from keys if hit overly agressive
-G Keys and space need additional backlighting to be fully lit
-lack of windows key is a bit of a let down. User specific im sure, but it would be much to add.(PC could just assign this to a G Key.

  I bought this keyboard to replace my gaming keyboard. The hype is all about mx cherry mechanical keyboards. Well... after buying over 9 different keyboards and many years testing. Nothing is better than being able to type on your keyboard without the whole world knowing you are typing. Simply put, if you are doing several things at once, imo I don't want my friends, family and maybe even clients to know I am typing on the computer doing 3 things at once. It's the worst thing when you can be heard doing other things when the other people are talking to you. This keyboard works great for everything. It has great response and mmo's are fine. Additionally, if this keyboard breaks who cares only like 20 bucks to replace it and not $200 like the average cost of a mx cherry keyboard.

  After being directed to take my company-issued laptop and work from home, I soon realized I needed a cheap keyboard for ergonomic purposes.  The company's caveat is that I'm not allowed to plug in any peripherals that have additional ports/inputs.This keyboard fit the bill: positive reviews, inexpensive, wired USB, no additional ports.  It arrived sooner than expected and worked right out of the box.  I really enjoy its low, quiet keys (I'm a loud typer), slim profile, and the fact that I now have a number keypad. For those that care, the keys do NOT light up (I don't need them to as I type without looking at my fingers).Once I'm allowed to return to the office, I may connect this keyboard to my personal laptop - so far I like it that much.

",$23.00 ,HP,,Ken Korczak,"No USB port, but overall great","Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2017","I like this keyboard quite a bit -- the first thing I want to warn you about is that it does not have a USB port. So if you are looking for a keyboard that you want to use with, say, a wireless mouse, you won't be able to do it with this keyboard. Just want to make sure you know that. The seller does not list a USB port in its description, so I'm not saying any deception is going on here, but, for the record, it does not have a USB port,.

Other than that, I am well satisfied with this item based on overall quality and price. The keys have nice, crisp action. It's really flat and narrow so it won't take up a lot of room on your desk. That's great.

I do notice a slight tendency for capital shift key to fail to produce a capital letter every time, but this is extremely minor, and maybe that's just my fault. Sometimes I have to go back and make sure the ""shift"" is well pressed to ensure it makes a cap.

Has good long cord with plenty of reach -- and also little tabs that open on the bottom so you can tilt it upward if you want.

All in all, this is a good basic keyboard that should provide many months or years of faithful use. Especially If you prefer flat keys as opposed to raised keys, then this is the keyboard for you.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  I bought this to replace a wireless keyboard that was also made by HP because the low profile of the keys makes it seem as if you don't have to be pushed down very far. I use it mostly for gaming, but I also do a fair amount of typing. For gaming, it's a little bit more forgivable that the keys need to be pushed down so far, because your fingers generally don't move very far from the WASD keys, but when typing, this is the first keyboard I've ever used that actually makes my hands hurt. I've never had a problem with carpal tunnel syndrome, which is one of the reasons I keep buying low-profile keyboards, but somehow, this keyboard has all of the same problems that high-profile keyboards have while just LOOKING like a low-profile keyboard. I miss keys all the time because I didn't put quite enough force into the button push. It's also a lot louder than I thought it would be. Coworkers frequently have to ask me to mute my microphone on conference calls because the keys are so loud. Even while typing slowly to avoid being quite as loud, they're still easily twice as loud as other low-profile keyboards. That being said, it's still not as loud as a mechanical keyboard, and that's probably the only reason I haven't replaced it already.Maybe you'll think this is a good thing, and maybe not, but this keyboard seems so sturdy that it isn't going to die any time soon. I feel as if I'm taking care of my depression-era grandmother who has dementia and keeps loudly singing Polish songs to herself in the middle of parties while I wait around for her to shed her mortal coil, but she's so hardy that she just won't go. At this point, I've spent the money, so I'm not going to smother it to death and replace it, but it's taking a toll on my hands and my sanity.

  I needed to replace the keyboard that came with my HP desktop. I've had it since 2012, and I would probably have never replaced it if it wasn't for the coronavirus. My daughter is basically doing online school like so many others across the country (and world even); but she's 10 and doesn't know how to type yet. My keyboard worked fine, but the letters were scratched off, so you can't see where the letters or anything were on it... it didn't matter to me, because as an adult I'm familiar with the QWERTY keyboard and I don't need to see the letters. I figured I'd replace the thing anyway. It's inexpensive. I just wanted to make sure it was an HP brand, but it's not the same one that I replaced though (to be honest, I think my original one was actually better). Basically bought it as a replacement so my daughter can learn how to eventually type.

Disappointed. 5 months is a ridiculously short shelf life on a product.Original review:Nice compact shape. Keys clack quite a bit and the board is flimsy. There is an odd blue light that stays on while it’s connected, which is not necessary. I tend to keep it connected to my laptop, even when not in use so the blue light gets distracting.

  It arrived late today, and I am in desperate need of a functioning keyboard for my Mac Mini. I picked up the package when the bell rang and it felt like nothing was in the package.

Then I started to notice the miss strikes on the keypad itself. ""It's cheap, and too light"" should be its two callouts in the listing. Don't get me wrong, there is a place for this keyboard, but it is not on any stationary system.

",$29.99 ,Macally,Multimedia,Brian Lev,A Little Small with Some Odd Habits but VERY Helpful (UPDATE: Increasingly Annoying),"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2020","
  UPDATE:  I've been using this keyboard intermittently over a 6-8 hour period every day -- roughly the equivalent of 4 hours continuous use per day.  The markings on several keys have begun to fade (the ""A"" key is now completely blank)... several keys (especially W and 1) need to be hit ""just so"" or nothing registers... and the key ""bounceback"" is slowly worsening so it's difficult to type at a normal pace because any time I try to type a double character I'll often only get one.  The keys in general are feeling a little looser and the keyboard is beginning to feel ""cheap"" compared to when I first started using it.  I'm disappointed & annoyed... will see what happens over the next few weeks.I've been using this keyboard daily since it arrived (a day early, thanks, Amazon!) and for the most part it's exactly what I had hoped for.  It's ever-so-slightly smaller than the keyboard on my 15"" Macbook Pro, so I periodically find myself hitting the wrong key -- but that problem is slowly going away as muscle memory changes to adapt to the new keyboard.  The key feel is OK; nothing awful, nothing spectacular, but key rebound is good & fast so there's no real problem there.  The keyboard does have a couple of odd things going on, though... 1) Key repeat doesn't always work; sometimes I can get repeating characters with very little pressure, sometimes I seem to have to really hold down the same key & wait through a short delay, and sometimes the same character refuses to repeat. 2) Some CMD-CTRL combined functions don't work (example: full screen view in Preview cannot be toggled on/off via the keyboard, I have to use onscreen menus).  I also have two additional caveats for prospective users: First, the extra-long cord is sometimes a godsend and sometimes a pain to deal with, depending upon how cluttered your workspace is; I recommend keeping it partially bunched up with a rubber band.  Second: When leaning across the keyboard to reach my laptop's trackpad, I often end up leaning my arm against the ""forward delete"" key in the upper right-hand corner. I *love* having this feature built into the keyboard, but it led to many an inadvertent renaming of files & folders, editing of documents, and loud ""EEPS"" from the laptop before I learned to keep my arm clear of that corner.  All in all, this keyboard is an excellent value for the money (my real rating is 4-1/2 stars), just be prepared for a few days' time to adjust your muscle memory.  I will definitely buy another if needed!

  I really like this keyboard and mouse. The keyboard has a low angle to it but isn't flat. The keys have plenty of spring for such a thin keyboard. The size is perfect for my hands. The mouse is also low profile and smaller than my previous mouse but no where near as small as a micro type mouse. I have used the pair for over a week now and have not had to recharge them yet. That said, when I do have to recharge them the cable will be a problem as it is way too short to be practical for me. Luckily I have a lot of longer micro USB cables that are longer so it is no big deal. The sleep function on the keyboard and mouse has a pretty quick timer. I don't really notice it on the keyboard as much since I just hit space to wake my computer. Now I tap it twice, once to wake the keyboard and once to wake the PC. The mouse just takes a left click to have it awake and working again. The waking speed is nearly instantaneous. All in all this was a good purchase at a good price.

  This keyboard and mouse has a very modern design and is extremely comfortable to use. I was concerned the mouse was going to be a bit too ""cheap feeling"" to want to use long-term, but it feels much better once it has the battery weight added. The mouse also has nice and quiet clicks; the bounce back feels really smooth. I like the right number pads too much to buy any new keyboards without that. So, I'm pleased to have this keyboard equipped with the right pad. As well, the key strokes feel solid, but still nice and quiet. The silicone cover is a nice add to this bundle. I'm pretty picky when it comes to a great keyboard and mouse, and I'm really excited to bring this one to my office for daily use. This is a really great value for what you get. I would certainly recommend this set to anyone looking for a sleek, comfortable, and quiet keyboard and mouse.

Das Keyboard 4 Professional Mechanical Keyboard - High Performance Soft Tactile Feedback - Enhanced 104 Key Layout - Cherry MX Brown Switches - Oversized Volume Knob - Two Port USB 3.0 - Full NKRO






",$169.00 ,Das Keyboard,Mechanical,Roger,Wanted to love it,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2017","I wanted to really like this keyboard, I found the sound soothing in video, but as a programmer, I type way too much and way too fast. The noise generated is really constant and really annoying. Compared to my standard Apple Magic Keyboard, I felt like I could glide across the keys and gently peck, but with this, I feel like I am having to jump onto narrow ledges and force down.

I don't understand why everyone is raving on about the ""quality"" of thing thing. This really doesn't feel all that different from a $50-60 Logitech you could pick up at your local electronics store.

Also, because the keyboard is so wide and much bigger compared to the ""Magic"" keyboard, I feel like I am putting much more effort in to reach for the mouse after I am done typing.

I'm going to use the keyboard for the week and hope I get used to it, I'll update my review then.

Das Keyboard 4 Professional Mechanical Keyboard - High Performance Soft Tactile Feedback - Enhanced 104 Key Layout - Cherry MX Brown Switches - Oversized Volume Knob - Two Port USB 3.0 - Full NKRO






",$169.00 ,Das Keyboard,Mechanical,davido,The luxury vehicle of keyboards.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 2, 2016","
  Growing up as a kid in the late 70's and early 80's, keyboards were mostly crisp, clacky, and sturdy. They evoked feelings of working on something special. Computers *were* special back then. Keyboards had well designed actions, built around techniques such as leaf spring mechanical switches, buckling springs, and a number of other innovations.  But over the years that followed mass production techniques and tightening profit margins led to the industry-wide adoption of lightweight, plastic-feeling keyboards with keystroke actions built upon rubber domes. Nowadays a typical OEM keyboard might have a production cost of a few dollars, and a spongy, rubbery action to match. We sailed right past midrange scissor switch actions into the low end rubber dome action with barely a thought, arriving at mediocrity.Mid-range keyboards from reputable manufacturers still build upon the rubber dome actions, so even upgrading from OEM or $12 keyboards to the $40 - $50 range significant improvements in the action are not found.  So again, we are duped into settling with mediocrity.There is hope out there. Cherry MX switches, Topre switches, and other mechanical style switches are being manufactured for keyboard actions. They're expensive compared to rubber dome keyboards. Each key has a mechanical switch of some sort beneath it, rather than a sheet of heat-molded rubber domes. And the mechanical switches are made with precise characteristics -- softer, firmer, clicky and tactile, non-clicky and tactile, and smooth linear.  Each style is designed with a different market segment in mind; linear being the preference of gamers, tactile (clicky or quiet) being the preference for those who's keystrokes produce text, softer for light-press typists, and firmer for mashers.The Cherry MX Brown is a soft, tactile, quiet key, with a subtle bump at the actuation point. With practice muscle-memory is able to get accustomed to that bump, and users become able to type without bottoming out the keys. Typing speed and accuracy often improve, and finger fatigue is reduced compared to typing on keyboards where you have to bottom out each stroke (rubber domes, for example).I debated back and forth between this keyboard and one from WASD, and ultimately went for the Das-4 because of the sturdy aluminum face and USB3 hub. It arrived today and I've had a chance to put it through its paces. While it may take a day or two to get used to the feel, it's going to be a pleasure getting there.  Lifting it, the keyboard feels like a tank.  Typing on it, the keyboard feels absolutely fantastic.  However, I may still add 2mm O-rings to reduce clatter, though I'll wait until I've gotten more accustomed to the tactile feel of Cherry MX Browns.  It's possible I'll develop more of a habit of not bottoming out my keystrokes.This sounds too predictable, but when I first plugged it in and began typing on it my first notion was ""Wow!""Pros: Heavy and sturdy like you might imagine a keyboard in a 1960's NASA mission control center.  A light, tactile, pleasing touch with ample stroke and precise response.  The tactile bump of Cherry MX Browns allows me to type without bottoming out the strokes. Already with a little practice my typing is feeling more effortless. USB 3 hub. Nice, sturdy media controls with a well-engineered volume knob. Beautiful design. If there is a better feeling and better engineered keyboard on the market, I sure can't find it.  The keycaps are crisply engineered, flawless, and elegant.Cons: Because it is built to last, and made of metal, bottoming out keystrokes makes a bit of clattering that you wouldn't be accustomed to if you have spent years obliviously enduring the misery of rubber-dome keyboards.  A set of 2mm O-rings would alleviate that issue, and they are easy enough to order.  It's too bad the keyboard manufacturer doesn't make O-rings a special-order option as WASD does.  Another con is that the keyboard's elevated support is a little on the low side -- the keyboard sits slightly flatter than I would prefer.  But after a few hours I'm already getting used to it.  Nearly every mechanical keyboard has a spacebar that seems to stick up a little higher in the air than space bars for dome keyboards. That takes a little time to get used to as well, but after awhile will begin to feel normal.Conclusion: If quality and feel are more important to you than price or RGB lights, this keyboard must be on your short list.  The keyboard seems to strive for elegance, feel, and function while eschewing trendy light shows and annoying color schemes.Updated 2/4/17: I've been using the DAS Keyboard 4 Professional with Cherry MX Brown key switches for a few months now. And I even installed first WASD red, and later WASD blue O-rings to further customize the feel. The keyboard feels so nice to use I barely notice it's there. It's a pleasure to type on.  ...and then I go home from my office, and when I sit down at the home computer I place my hands over the mid-range ""rubber dome"" style keyboard, and loathe every moment. The solution? I ordered a second DAS Keyboard 4 Professional and a set of WASD blue o-rings. One at work, one at home. Great keyboards!Updated 9/30/2017:  I've been using one of these at my office, and one at home. The one that has had the most use is in my office.  I'm a software engineer, and type all day long.  The key caps have become a little polished, but the symbols have not faded at all. The key strokes feel as good as the day I got the keyboard.  ...maybe even a little better with age.  It's my ""daily driver"".  Recently my company provided a second office for me a little closer to home, with the understanding that I would split my time between the offices.  For my third mechanical keyboard I ended up going with a Logitch Professional (tenkey-less, with Roamer-G switches).  The Roamer-G switches have a slightly shorter keystroke, and the overall feel of that keyboard is more plastic.  The Roamer-G switches don't allow for o-ring installation, so it clatters a little more too.  But I had to try something new.  One thing I can say for the Roamer-G switches is that they feel smoother right out of the box than Cherry-MX Browns.  But with age the MX Browns acquire that smooth feeling too.  Overall I'm convinced that I like the Das Keyboard better. (A few weeks of use and I have to conclude the MX browns are smoother, and feel more high-end. Sticking with browns in the future.)Update 12/2018: I now have the same keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches. I put blue O-rings under its key caps to reduce bottoming-out clatter.  It took longer to get used to the click blues than the subtle browns, but I also like them very much. If it weren't for the fact that the noise level using blues is higher than when using browns (disturbing to others but gratifying to the typist) I would have to say for typing I prefer the nuanced qualities of both. The blues feel a little more crisp, slightly firmer. Browns a little less tactile, and a little softer touch. Both are excellent. If you don't care about making some noise typing, and want additional crispness, get the blues.If you are a gamer do not get the blues, as their reset point is higher in the stroke than the contact point, making them slower switches for rapid bouncing on a single key. Totally irrelevant for typists.Browns: softer touch, more subtle tactile bump, quieter. Blues: clicker, more crisp feel, slughtly firmer spring. Both, excellent.Update 6/30/2020: I have three of these, now. One at each if my two offices, and one at home. Two of them are MX Brown switches (soft tactile) and one is MX Blue (soft tactile&clicky).  I got the blue on accident (thought I was ordering a brown), but kept it and love it too. I've now been typing on these since 2016, and they're still as good as new. The key caps are easy enough to remove for the occasional deep cleaning, but if you avoid spilling drinks on them these keyboards are built to last. They get plenty of use, but aside from the key caps having a more polished look to them you would barely know they're several years old. And the laser etching is still intact. The switches still feel great too.

  The keyboard itself is excellent.  The improvements over the 3 are all spot on; the volume knob is a joy to turn, and the steel case feels great.But there's one seriously idiotic flaw.  The feet.Somebody had this inane idea to make the feet a magnetic ruler that sticks on the bottom.  Except that it doesn't stick.  Pull the keyboard towards you?  Falls off.  Push it back?  Falls off.  The tiny rubber constraints do nothing to keep it in place.It just baffles me that an otherwise perfect keyboard could have made it through testing without somebody saying ""a magnetic ruler as feet for a keyboard?  what the heck?""Just give me the normal feet back please...2019 update:  after supergluing the feet to the keyboard, no other complaints. I have the blue at home and the brown at work, and they've both been working flawlessly every day for years now.

  The good:First, let me say the keyboard is sweet.  Build quality is top notch.  My only complaint with the design is that the I would like a bit more of an angle than the ruler provides.  But that may just be a personal preference.The bad...I had a switch go bad after about 5 months.  I reached out to support and they did offer to repair it, but their terms were unacceptable to me.  They wanted me to send them the keyboard at my cost for 10-15 days, then they would return it at their cost.  Maybe I am being out of line, but I can not go 15 days without a keyboard, and I don't think I should need to pay anything to get a $160 keyboard fixed that is still under warranty...  I would much rather them ship me a replacement and a prepaid label for my old one to return.

This is a nice solid and compact keyboard, meaning there isn't a separate number pad which I prefer. Never used it anyways and I like the extra space it gives me. The acrylic base is quite a nice surprise, it has a pretty, diffused glow, looks even nicer in person than the pics, and even my non-gaming family admires it! Make no mistake, just because the base is acrylic doesn't mean it's light, it has a good weight and definitely feels sturdy enough to stand up to some tough gaming. I also love the touch and response of the keys, I'm not a pro when it comes to measuring force or what so ever, but I know my games, and boy this does the job wonderfully. I'm actually considering getting another one for work, but being wfh now I'll see what happens.

",$69.99 ,RGB Ducky,Gaming,Aleksgee,10-Oct,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2020","so i bought this board out of pure boredom and the lights lol but i have others to compare, such as the asceny mechanical board with black switches. GMMK glorious compact board which is a good 120-130 ish bucks with brown switches.
And out of both of those i mentioned, glorious being the most expensive and very worth the buy, i find that this board is my main one now, its actually nice, from the lighting effects to being able to swap switches, however, dont expect a top tier or 300 dollar kind of experience, its definitely a good buy and a big upgrade from asceny in my opinion, its a bit more compact too as this is longer instead of wide, which to me makes it feel easier and more comfortable to use for extended hours at a time, i think there is a 60% option i got the ten-keyless , so i have the arrow keys still, but i feel the compact version if they have,(i should of checked before this) would be even better if you dont mind losing the arrows. either way this is compact and works perfect. with red switches it feels buttery, also i thought id mention that i find myself sometimes thinking i didnt press the key but i did, thats how smooth it is for me and then vice versa, sometimes i feel like i did but didnt.

NOTE;; i believe this board can almost use any switch but always double triple check, i am not an expert, just someone with who enjoys testing and trying products, which are keyboards and switches.
Now i think this takes non plated switches as well because my GMMK takes that and i went to use these reds on the GMMK but found these wont work, however the browns on my Glorious board were able to fit on the womier. plated has those extra little pins, non plated does not.

You can do some upgrades to this womier that would make it even better, from different stabilizers to lubing the switch a little. I would recommend that if you are experienced with it.

Aside form here on amazon where i don't really suggest buying from for switches unless you can find a really good deal, i recommend going to novelkeys for switches, cheaper and they have a huge selection. plus they explain more on the different switches and what is compatible :):):):) this was long but i know someone out there is reading this and likes it lol i try to be critical without pushing a brand too much or a sale. i don't get paid this stuff :P

oh oh i don't actually know if this has hardware to further customize colors but do know this has a good amount of options, I'm sure you'll find something that works. you can also control 2 lighting modes, the top with keys and the bottom and/or sides, you cant do too much with the bottom/sides though but you can also turn it off completely which i like if you just want to have the keys.

Hope this helped, if you buy it give this review a thumbs up or whatever. bye :)",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

It matches my HP monitor color. thin keyboard design with quiet tapping. This is the feature I need most since my newborn's crib is in the same room with me, I have to work from home while looking after my baby so the typing must be "" silent "" and "" soft "".

The connection is also plausible, no delay on screen, controls my MacBook perfectly, it also reduces the usage on my MacBook keyboard so overall a great deal !

Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard 60% Compact 87 Key Kumara Wired Cherry MX Blue Switches Equivalent for Windows PC Gamers (RGB Backlit White)






",$49.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,ShardsOfBlue,Clacky boi can be tamed,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2019","We stan a clacky boi and boi does he clack.

Tl;dr? This little roaring dragon is a fun little attention hog and worth the very little bit of effort it takes to tame. O-rings and a towel did the trick.

The little Kumara is like an excitable younger sibling compared to the other mechanical keyboard I have. It's bright and loud and wants attention, and I love it.

COLOR / LIGHTS:

It's got so many RGB presets I don't think it even remembers what they all are: sweep left/right, pulse, shimmer, fade, pulse, solid color, touch light-up — the list goes on. (You can cycle through them all mechanically with FN+INS through PgDn and change the color of the solid-color ones or the pulse direction with the arrow keys.) The white case/keys make the RGB lights pop. And it's got quite a lot to say while you're typing.

SWITCHES:

These blue switch keys have a bright, bouncy feeling to them that I can't get enough of, along with their satisfying click.

SOUND:

It's not just the blue switches that make it audibly loud. Three sounds make this little wyrm the loudest in his clutch: (1) you've got your clicks, which come from the switches themselves; (2) you've got your clacks, which come from the plastic keycaps striking the body when they bottom out; and (3) you've got a ping resonating through the metal body when the keys pop back into place. Take all those and put them on a metal/plastic combo body that amplifies like a drum and you've got a keyboard that sounds like a room full of tiny, angry, old-timey reporters live inside.

But don't be scared off by the Kumara's roar. It can be tamed! Don't get me wrong, this will never be a quiet keyboard, but you shouldn't be looking at blue switches if you want quiet, anyway (switches are differentiated by color; blues are designed to go ""click!"").

MODIFICATION:

Here's how I brought this wyrm to heel:

Redragon K552 Mechanical Gaming Keyboard 60% Compact 87 Key Kumara Wired Cherry MX Blue Switches Equivalent for Windows PC Gamers (RGB Backlit White)






",$49.99 ,Redragon,Gaming,Will,Solid keyboard with lots of features,"Reviewed in the United States on February 13, 2020","Reviewed: White w/ RGB lights, blue switches
Overall rating: 9/10 (36/40 = 90% recommendation)

After doing alot of research, I chose this keyboard based on a few factors that were very important to me: PRICE, QUALITY, FUNCTION, & AESTHETICS. As I was in the market for a keyboard for the purposes of typing, gaming is not a factor in this review. Overall, I think this keyboard delivered pretty well in almost all areas that were key in my purchasing decision.

Price: 10/10
Of course I would always want the lowest price possible, but I think given the quality and features of this keyboard, the price is pretty reasonable - especially considering that it feels substantial (overall good build quality, metal construction) and the high number of very customizable lighting effects. At this price, from what I could find, this keyboard simply can't be beat.

Quality: 10/10
I am really impressed by how solid this keyboard feels. The base is sturdy, the LEDs are very bright (with beautifully smooth transitions), and the blue switches provide delicious tactile and audible feedback. It makes this keyboard truly a joy to use (yes, I am writing this review with it right now!). The keycaps themselves are a hard plastic that adds to the well-made and solid feeling of the keyboard overall.

Function: 7/10
While overall the keyboard is received is perfectly functional, I was ideally looking for one in this same style (white, RGB, mechanical), but with a 10 key number pad built in as well. It just does not exist for the most part. There are other brands that provide the 10 key functionality, but based on those reviews they are either not good quality, or in my search others were out of the price range for what I was willing to spend. Additionally, I use a Mac - while this keyboard is basically compatible, I would love to see some options for an RGB mechanical keyboard that is more made for Mac. This one gets the job done - but it does leave some to be desired as far as dedicated features go. As I stated earlier under quality, the function of the keys is incredibly satisfying to type on. I have also found the functions to choose the color pattern and speed of the LEDs to be straightforward and easy to use. I am particularly impressed by the smooth, beautiful transitions and fades of the built-in patterns.

Aesthetics: 9/10
Finally - I was specifically looking for a white mechanical keyboard with RGB functionality. I know that this limited my options substantially right off the bat. I chose this one because the layout is simple and beautiful, the range and possibility of LED color combinations, and for its compact size (if I couldn't find a 10 key option, I figured my next best bet was to choose one that was reasonably compact). The font of the keycaps is not a personal favorite of mine, so I could see myself potentially changing out the keycaps at some point, but that is a low priority for me in the grand scheme. Overall, this keyboard looks great on my desk and I am really pleased with the compact size and the white color. Other than not having a 10 key option, this keyboard was aesthetically almost EXACTLY what I had envisioned.

Overall I am very satisfied with this keyboard and I am happy that I chose it. I will update this review should anything change or if I realize I forgot to mention any important aspects. I hope this review has been helpful to you, and thanks for reading!",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  Just got my keyboard today.  First thing I did was open a testing utility and check all the keys and run a WPM typing test.  Everything works perfect and it's very easy to type with.  It feels solid and doesn't slide around. The metal frame looks great and the lighting is awesome.  I changed the colors on my laptop to mirror this and it looks amazing. The functions all work well and easily adjust the lighting from on/off/breath, brightness and breath rate. The shortcuts are nice to have with the F-Keys. I really like how the lighting lights up under the edges of the keyboard too as you can see from my pictures. It creates a really cool effect reflecting off my granite desktop.  Highly recommended.

The construction is solid. It has a substantial weight to it and doesn't slide around on my desk. The key presses feel perfect for me (just the right amount of feedback), but they don't make a lot of noise. I wouldn't call it ""silent,"" but it's quieter than your average keyboard, I'd wager.

Keychron K4 Bluetooth Wireless Mechanical Keyboard, Optical Blue Switch Gaming Keyboard with White LED Backlit Wired USB C 100 Keys N-Key Rollover, Computer Keyboard for Mac Windows PC Gamer Typist






",,Keychron,Gaming,casen davis,Excellent keyboard with a few bad design decisions,"Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2020","I purchased this keyboard because the product description describes a USB-C cable used to plug in the keyboard. What was not clear was that it is USB-C into the keyboard, and regular USB into the computer. I wanted both ends to be USBC so I could eliminate the weird dongle on my Mac.

The other reason I bought this keyboard was that it could connect to multiple devices over blue-tooth. I've discovered that the blue-tooth works seamlessly, but it will disconnect after only a short time of inactivity. If I am reading on my computer for a very short while, it will disconnect, and then I will go to type again and it does not work for a few moments as it reconnects again. If I had to guess, it disconnects after about 1 minute of inactivity.

Finally, the batter life seems pretty short considering the size and weight of the keyboard. I figured there was a large enough battery in there that it would last for days and days without recharging. It seems to last maybe one work day.

If those three issues were remedied, this would probably be the very best keyboard on the market. I still enjoy using the keyboard very much despite these shortcomings.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",,Keychron,Gaming,Merina Rundall,"excellent mechanical keyboard for typists: compact, professional looking, and inexpensive.","Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2020","i cannot say enough good things about this keyboard. i love mechanical keyboards because my job requires me to type a lot over 10-12 hour shifts, and they relieve hand/finger/wrist fatigue. the thing is, a lot of mechanical keyboards are made for gamers, so they're quite large, have extra customizable keys and unnecessary lighting effects, and have to be wired (cough... my razer...). any compact keyboards don't have 10 key which i need. so the keychron fit my standards. i knew nothing about the brand and originally preferred to stick with the tried and true brands like logitech g series, razer, corsair, and das, but i'm so glad i took the leap of faith on this. besides, the keychron is way cheaper than the logitech lightspeed wireless mechanical keyboard i had my eyes on. way, way cheaper.

because i work in an office with shared desks, swapping the default keyboard with this one is convenient because all i need is to plug in the bluetooth dongle (a third party one sold separately, as the work computers don't have onboard bluetooth capabilities like most personal laptops/computers) instead of having to take up 2 USB ports like my blackwidow did. i like that i don't have to move everything out of the way to fit my own keyboard on the desk. it's small enough to fit right into my desk drawer at the end of my shift, or in my bag if i want to bring it home. it looks very sleek and professional - especially without the RGB backlights. however, if you do want a bit of fun, there are different lighting patterns you can choose from, and it's easy to change it: just press the key. no special software needed.

yes, the blue switches are loud. this was exactly the type of switch i wanted and know the audible consequence for it, so no stars deducted. if you don't want a loud clicky keyboard, avoid the blue switches. if you don't know what kind of switch to get, I recommend going to somewhere like best buy and testing the gaming keyboards there. once you find a switch you like, go online and search for the gateron equivalent. the brown might be good if you want a similar feel but a quieter sound though. in any case, research your mechanical switches before buying.

since i've only had it for a couple of weeks, i can't speak on the battery life. but i do like that i have the option of using the USB C connector.

although i haven't used it at home on my mac, i like that i have the option to easily change the keys and the operation to be mac friendly. i think this is the first mechanical keyboard i've found that works specifically for mac. i currently use a logitech g keyboard at home and while it works great, it's still a windows-centric keyboard. i may end up buying another for home use.

it may take some time to get used to the size. i found myself reaching too far over to the right to use the num pad or missing the shift key. not a huge deal. just takes some time to build the muscle memory.

overall A+ 10/10 highly recommend. in fact, i've already recommended it to others.",TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Logitech K830 Illuminated Living-Room Keyboard with Built-in Touchpad – Easy-access Media Keys and Shortcut Keys for Windows or Android






",$75.98 ,Logitech,,RCR,Comparison of Wireless + Illuminated Keyboards,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2019","I wanted a wireless + illuminated keyboard for my pc/tv media server. The two options were Logitech K830 ($60) and Rii ($27). I bought both to compare.

Appearance: Rii is lighter weight, but Logitech is more sturdy/sleek/pretty. Unfortunately, Logitech Logitech doesn't have space, for storing the USB dongle, whereas Rii does.

Scrolling: I liked that the Rii has a scroll function on the right side of touchpad, and was about to return the Logitech for its lack of one because it's pretty important when no mouse. But then read the manual, which explains that you use 2 fingers to scroll on the Logitech. So, equal here.

Buttons: Logitech has dedicated mouse buttons (preferred), whereas they're built into the Rii touchpad. Logitech also has dedicated volume buttons, whereas the Rii does volume with the function buttons.

Illumination pt1: Big minus on Logitech is that the function keys are not illuminated! So finding the F11 key to go fullscreen when watching a video is a pain. However, I plan to resolve this by putting a sticker/something near frequently used function keys. All buttons on the Rii are illuminated.

Illumination pt2: Colorwise, the Rii has 3 options of green/purple/red backlighting. Logitech only has one option. However, that option is white and I like white the most (no white on Rii). I was initially annoyed by Logitech's ""light sensor"", but the manual explains how to override that to select whichever brightness you want.

Touchpad: After reading all the negative reviews about Rii's touchpad, I expected it to be really bad, but it's not that bad at all. If Rii where the only keyboard I had order, I would have found it completely acceptable. However, I then tested the Logitech... which is perfectly smooth.

Final decision: Both keyboards get 4 stars from me. If I weren't planning to use this keyboard very often, I would stick with the much less expensive Rii. Not having illuminated function keys on the Logitech is inconvenient given my usage. But after testing Logitech's much smoother touchpad, I'm returning the Rii. The Rii touchpad is not terrible, but if they'd just improve that one feature, they'd have a better keyboard than Logitech for ~half the price.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Logitech K830 Illuminated Living-Room Keyboard with Built-in Touchpad – Easy-access Media Keys and Shortcut Keys for Windows or Android






",$75.98 ,Logitech,,Rick A. Matschke,"love it right off the bat, UPDATED 3-12-18","Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2018","Received this only this morning (overnight by the way), love it right off the bat.....ONLY complaint is that the space bar makes noise whenever it is pushed....other than that, it's a 5!

The question I have is whether the space abr should be making a rattly noise whenever it is pushed???..NO other keys make a sound!

UPDATE: 3-12-18, I began having some issues with this keyboard where it would just 'lose' connection with the cursor (computer) and seemingly disappear from the screen. Other issues would be after dwelling while writing, it would miss the first 3 or 4 letters typed before restarting for me. The keyboard is otherwise very nice in every respect. Fortunately, when I finally had enough of the 'disconnect' issue, I contacted Amazon who did not hesitate to offer me either a refund or a replacement despite being a little over 30 days old. When I asked about it's general history they said it was a rare malfunction, and rereading reviews did not find that issue listed...so I took the replacement, got it in 2 days, its working fine so far...but as a note, the space bar is also a little noisy compared to my K800's! AMAZON remains the best outlet out there, great prices, shipping and of course amazing customer service that is easily contacted and chatted with at any time, any day!

UPDATE 3/31/18 : This second one too became a disappointment so went back to the trusty K800 I still had, a far better keyboard. I designated the 830 to my laptop where I use it at the beach house with very little urgency and virtually zero expectations of literacy or accuracy...I'm disappointed that Logitech would place a higher number on this keyboard....save your money, but something else!....I remain a faithful amazon customer because of their tireless efforts to satisfy their customers, but disappoint that they sell this item!",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Macally Mac Keyboard Full-Size & Number Keypad (Metal Frame) 2 USB Ports Hub & Wired USB Cable - Apple Computer Keyboards for Mac, Pro, MacBook, Pro, Air Laptops (Silver Aluminum) MLUXKEYA






",,Macally,QWERTY,Andy,piece of junk - broke in less than 1 year,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2019","Pros:
+One of my deciding factors was the reviews.
+My other deciding factor was that, if you'll look at the Macally keyboard, the keys match the macbook pro almost exactly! (most similar keyboards will switch them around or not include one) -- on the left side, ""Fn, control, option, cmd"" and on the right, ""cmd, option, fn, control"" (I use the left side commands more, so that was imperative for me to find). It also has the commands at the top with the F-keys, as well as some extra ones to help out.
+It has the numeric keyboard on the right (I believe that to get that with the Apple's stock keyboard, you had to purchase a separate addition?).
+The home/end keys work well with most programs (except Wordpress - there, it works more like shoot me to the top or bottom of the page).
+It feels like an apple keyboard, also (which also has its cons). The keys have sort of a matte feel to them, are thin and not too raised on the board, they look nice, and it doesn't slide around as I type.
+I can type fast and it gets every keystroke (works well with fast typists)
+I like that it has a USB cord, versus being wireless, because I don't have to worry about batteries. I think this also helps allow it to be thin and relatively flat (just a slight incline).
+Although I don't use it, it does have a power button. I don't know if that's for the keyboard or the computer as a whole, though (I don't want to try it as I'm typing this).
+Volume control on keyboard
+play/fast-forward/fast-reverse on F-buttons
+cut/copy/paste on F-buttons
+Screen brightness controls on F-buttons
+Print Screen (F12)
+Arrow keys
+""clear"" button on numeric keyboard
+You know how when you want to zoom in on the browser page, you usually hit ""ctrl"" and the plus sign? this keyboard has zoom in/zoom out buttons.

Cons:
-The CD Rom ""Eject"" button is right above the delete key, which is easy to sometimes hit by accident, which becomes annoying at times.
-Because the keys are flat, and not indented like many of the larger keys on other keyboards, it's taking some time to get used to typing on the numerical keyboard without looking. My fingers tend to slide around and have difficulty finding the ""5"" to reset.
-Sometimes the Caps Lock light goes on, and sometimes it doesn't. I don't know if this is a flaw, or if it just doesn't do it with some programs or websites.

Update:
I bought this in October, 2018.
Now, in September, 2019, (less than 1 year), I'm noticing some of the keys no longer working. For instance, even while typing this, I have to constantly backspace to make the ""t"" and ""f"" work. Most often lately, they don't work while typing and I have to go back (and the backspace on here is faster when I hit it constantly than just holding it down), or tap it hard to work.

So it's a great keyboard if you're looking for something that matches up with the Mac keyboard.
But it's not a great keyboard if you hope to keep it for more than a year.
On that note, less than a year later, I'm now looking to buy a new keyboard, and you can be sure it won't be anything from Macally.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  Like other reviewers, I found the keys to be very hard (surface of the keys were hard and the keys were firm and 'clicked' vs soft Apple keyboard feel)  to type on and slightly different in shape and design than the Apple wired keyboard I was replacing. This, along with the ""flat"" pitch of the keyboard made it very uncomfortable and clumsy to work with. I sent the keyboard back the same day I received it and replaced it with a refurbished wired Apple keyboard. This keyboard worked/operated fine, it was just the overall ""feel' and performance of it was not like an Apple product and, to my surprise, it really slowed my productivity.

  I checked with customer service, and I have to unplug it and plug it back in, which does solve the problem for a few hours, but it happens again the next day.  The keyboard is also flat, so I have to prop it up so I can touch type.  It just doesn't feel like a regular keyboard, which I guess that I can get used to,  But the caps lock problem is very frustrating; I have to stand up, turn the computer around so I can reach the USB port, unplug the cord, plug it back in, turn the computer back around, sit back down, and get comfortable again, all of which takes over a minute.  I might just return it, and pay more for a genuine Apple keyboard.

  Needed a replacement keyboard for my work computer (Macbook Pro, Mid-2015), since my normal accessories are stuck at work and I am forbidden to go there.  The accessories there are Macally, and I wanted to replicate what I had there.This keyboard is better than the one I have at work!  It's much thinner, which seems to be helping the occasional carpal tunnel I've had.  It's also quieter.  The keys seem to be a bit grippier, and it doesn't have the stupid ""Print Screen"" button above Delete, which has cut down on the number of issues.  I love that this has 2 USB ports on the back, as my MBP only has 2, and one of them has to have a card reader, which limits me to essentially one USB port on the computer.  So I can plug the mouse into the keyboard and life is good!Highly recommended for anyone who needs a keyboard to work with a Mac!

But the mouse is just a cheap one you can get at a local dollar tree. Not kidding. The keyboard I do like. I have kids and it makes very little noise. It cheap made but sturdy. That counts for me.

UpDate: The keyBoard is still going. I gave it an extra half star for durability... It has survived and worked despite the two spills. My son so far spilled milk. It cleaned up and the key does not stick. I have dropped my coffee on it. It still works. Now sadly now make a sound. That is really not a problem. Kids are older. I figure out the original problem of getting a new keyboard/mouse. I just switch when the twins are asleep.

Here the thing. The tech guy who came up for another problem very easly installed a much need file. Two thumbs up. Good buy point and click. hello key binds.

The only thing irks me( very little) was never received the replacement of the mouse. That now not a big deal. The keyboard has one good thing drurability. It like the thing refused to die. If anyone has that concern. Thatis is one thing keyboard does not lack. Hope to survive and my hand survives the fun key binds on keyboard experience.

Confused. They sent the exact same mouse(much bigger) and keyboard. Not sure what happen. Wow much, much better. It is like night and day. Better response time for both. The keyboard is way more functionally now. So what happen. Very impressed. They look and seem to be identical. But no longer have teh cheap feel in the mouse.",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

  It is not quite as good as the OE keyboard in some aspects, but so far I haven't had any major complaints. There are a few features I liked about the Microsoft keyboard that this one does not have. Your Surface won't automatically go to sleep when you fold the keyboard closed. You will also have to hit a key to get the keyboard to re-sync each time you let it sit for more than 3 minutes. Lastly, the track pad registers as a mouse wheel in the settings. If you're used to being a ""southpaw"" scroller like I am, you won't be able to change the 2-finger scrolling direction. I do like the battery life. I've only had to charge the keyboard once in about 15hrs of use. The charge cable has a magnetic connection that's a bit finicky, however.

  For the price I paid, I got what paid for.  The unit fits on my Surface Pro 17 just fine (does not plug into the Surface, only magnetically snaps to the bottom, i.e., does not interface/charge via the Surface).  It does fold over the Surface screen just as if it was genuine Microsoft product which  was really cool and magnet grip is really, really strong - it won't fall off from the Surface.  The lighted key are bright enough to be used in the dark, but the keys go off after 10-15 seconds of non-use.  The only troubling thing is the charging port.  It has to be the most strangest powering port in the world.  Takes me quite an effort to get it to engage (magnetic hold in place and right in way of use making charging while in use a little difficult).  So far, the thing has stayed charged for five eight-hour use days without running out of juice.  Only other thing is when attached to the Surface it jacks up the keyboard as if it had fold out feet like you see on a normal keyboard.  That is not an issue for me (I like a sloped keyboard), but it is so thin, it ""oilcans"" (i.e. bows with pressure) as opposed to laying flat on the desktop.  A little annoying, but usable.  Also, it starts up with the NUMLOCK always on which disables the letter keys, so you have to remember to turn off NUUMLOCK each time you start it up.  SUPER ANNOYING!  Not sure why it would default to that configuration?

",$34.99 ,Logitech,Wireless,Ken Nuckolls,How to fix LAG on keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2018","
  I very nearly gave this wireless keyboard/mouse a one star rating and a lousy review. For the first few hours, I battled with unpredictable periods of truly awful keyboard lag. Like waiting 30 seconds for it to wake up and accept my keystrokes. It was very very frustrating. I was on the verge of boxing it up and sending it back when I tried positioning the PC so the USB dongle was in line of sight of the keyboard and mouse. Aha! They both worked flawlessly.  -  This was not a practical solution though as I didn't want to use up one of my front USB ports, so I added a USB extension cable to the rear USB port I was using; plugged the dongle into that and then positioned the dongle in line of sight of the keyboard and mouse but in an unobtrusive location. So, if you are on the verge of tossing yours, try this solution. It's working like a champ now. No delays.

Logitech MK345 Wireless Combo Full-Sized Keyboard with Palm Rest and Comfortable Right-Handed Mouse - Black






",$34.99 ,Logitech,Wireless,Deep Thought,Solid Basic Wireless Keyboard/Mouse Combo,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2015","Logitech Wireless Combo MK345

I consider this a BASIC or starter wireless keyboard and mouse, and I am reviewing it IN THAT CONTEXT (even though there are a couple of Logitech wireless combos that are below this one). In that regard, it is quite good.

Right from the outset I was very impressed with it's no-hassle plug and play aspect. I literally removed it from the box (batteries came already installed), plugged the tiny nano-receiver into a USB port on the old laptop that I happened to have handy at the time (a 7 year old machine running Windows Vista) and both the keyboard and mouse were recognized and responsive in under 30 seconds. From box to working in a minute or two. That is probably record time for any computer accessory that I've ever installed.

➤'TIP: While this is plug-and-play and works perfectly without installing any drivers or software, you can get some added functionality if you install Logitech's Setpoint software. I have provided the link for it on the bottom of this review.

'➤IMPORTANT NOTE: Many people comment that the mouse is small. This is partially an ILLUSION due to the SHAPE of the mouse, which is a bit different from others. If you see my comparison photos, you will see that it is not much smaller than other mice.
I used two standard size mice and one very small travel mouse for comparison. Some people have also commented on the light weight of the mouse. This is actually true as it is in fact relatively light:

Here are my weight comparisons (without/with batteries):

Included Mouse (M275)-63g/86g VX Revolution (M-RBU126)- 83g/110g Marathon (M705)-87g/135g
VX Nano (M-RC134)-73/95g

FIRST IMPRESSION (Overall): Both the keyboard and the mouse are fairly light. There is protective plastic on the keyboard which once removed reveals an attractive glossy surface around the key portion of it. The palm rest has a flat rather than glossy finish and has small indentations which give it some very subtle texture. The mouse has a very narrow wraparound glossy collar (also covered with protective plastic). The sides (indentation for thumb and opposite side) have the same flat sheen and textured design as on the keyboard's palm-rest. The result is a sort of two-toned black on black look. Aesthetically, the mouse and keyboard co-ordinate very well.

MOUSE: This is quite obviously a right-handed mouse. Some might consider the mouse to be on the SMALLER side. This is really a MATTER OF PREFERENCE and as I already noted, this is largely an illusion. I have used both larger and smaller mice and sometimes it is just a matter of what you are accustomed to. I usually prefer the smaller mice because they seem easier to maneuver around with subtle finger movements. It has an overall ergonomic shape that feels pretty comfortable and natural in my own medium-sized hand. I can understand those with bigger hands preferring something a little more substantial. This is a great mouse to use with a laptop (or as a dual-use travel/stationary mouse), especially since it works with the nano receiver and has the small look.

This is a no-frills mouse. It has the basic left and right click button and wheel. It does not have any extra buttons that you find on some other mice that are usually programmed to move forwards or backwards through web pages, zoom, etc. The wheel does have a push button. When depressed, it puts the mouse into a 4-way scroll mode, that is you can scroll in four directions around a page by moving the mouse as you would normally move the cursor. Depress again to return to cursor control. It is made of a rubber-like material which gives it a nice feel.

The mouse seems responsive and I have not had any issues with losing connectivity so far.

KEYBOARD: Normal full-sized keyboard. There is an on/off switch and an LED Caps Lock indicator. The ""Function"" and ""Control"" keys might be a little larger than on other keyboards (especially the Function key) and it seems like the space bar was made a little smaller to accommodate this. I have not found it to be a problem for me, but felt I should note it any way. There are the typical flip-out feet to set the keyboard on an angle. The palm-rest is angled nicely and feels a comfortable size, not too obtrusive nor too diminutive. The keys feel soft when pressed and are fairly quiet. Logitech claims this to be a spill-resistant design. I have not tested this out yet, but if you knew me, you'd know that I will be able to report on this feature fairly soon.

There is a full range of function keys across the top with default shortcut/media keys displayed as icons (Home, Mail, Search, Calculator, Media Player, Previous, Play/Pause, Next, Mute, Decrease Volume, Increase Volume). You need to download the Setpoint software from Logitech's website for these to work properly and the way that you want them to.

BATTERY LIFE: Logitech claims that this combo has ""Advanced energy-efficient design"" which should yield a very generous battery life of 3 years for the keyboard and 18 months for the mouse. Of course there is no way to prove or disprove this just yet.

IN CONCLUSION: I will say again that this is good basic or starter combo. If you are in the market for such for yourself or someone else, I don't think that you can go wrong with this. The main point should be making sure that the user will be comfortable with a smaller rather than more substantial mouse (at the risk of sounding sexist I will go out on a limb and say that this mouse is probably perfectly suited for many female users). If it is for someone who is not a gamer/cutting edge/latest gadget type of a person who just needs the best of the basics without a lot of extras, than this might just be perfect.

It is also a good choice if you need something fairly portable or for occasional use with a laptop.

  This is meant for a low-use office computer and has served its purpose quite well thus far. I've read the negative comments and I think I can help clear your mind. Yes, the mouse is relatively small - not a dealbreaker if you've got: smaller hands, normal sized hands, or use the computer in question infrequently. Know what else is small? The USB dongle associated with this! Which makes it a breeze to swap between computers, like in my case a desktop/latptop. Paired instantly, keyboard/mouse had a good response rate off the bat on both my Macbook and PC desktop. This is a simple middle of the road wireless combo set. I would recommend for casual users. Obviously not for gamers or hardcore office desk warriors. If you're in the sweet spot, do yourself a favor spend up a little bit and get a reliable setup like this from a reliable company like logitech.

  I love this keyboard/mouse combo.  It was super easy to install. I just plugged it in & my laptop automatically recognized the devices. All I had to do was pulled out the battery tabs & I was set.The keyboard has back tabs that when opened, tilt the keyboard by 7°.  The keys are not flat by raised in a traditional keyboard fashion which I prefer for touch typing.  The keys are easy to press. It’s quiet enough but when I really get into typing, you can really hear the tapping of the keys which might be annoying for the people around in a quiet office but it doesn’t sound any different from other keyboards of this type. I find the keyboards with the flatter keys to be much quieter.  The palm rest is made of a hard plastic but it is comfortable against the bottom of your palm while typing.The mouse ergonomically fits in the palm nicely and works smoothly in my desktop (both my computer desktop & my actual desktop).  I think this package set was a fantastic deal!

Redragon K512 Shiva RGB Backlit Membrane Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys, Quiet Mechanical Feeling Keyboard, 6 Extra On-Board Macro Keys, Dedicated Media Control, Detachable Wrist Rest






",$39.99 ,Membrane,,aroveruser,Perfect non-mechanical keyboard,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2019","
  I purchased this keyboard because I am long time fan of the consistent quality I receive from Redragon products and I was in need of a non-mechanical keyboard for my girlfriend as she doesn't enjoy the clicking of a mechanical keyboard, yet does enjoy the feeling of typing on one. This keyboard is a perfect choice for anyone that is looking to get that mechanical like feeling without all the noise. It is very quiet to type on and the keys provide a good amount of resistance as if you were typing on actual mechanical keyboard (might be a bit heavier resistance than my k580). Apart from the keyboard itself, I did have some issues adjusting my typing as they put the 'G' keys on the left side instead of top like some of my other boards. I kept making mistakes at first when typing, but that is something that is negligible once your hands are adjusted for the keyboard. Another thing that I do not count against this keyboard is that there are less options for color animations. The led's are bright and beautiful, but you only have about 7 options of setup compared to my other boards that had up to 18. This is understandable though, as unlike my mechanical boards, the leds on this board are not individualized to each key, but rather share 1/6 of the board at a time. If you use the customized lighting configuration (which is poorly explained how to use in the manual), you will see that after activating it using Fn+PgUp, you then use the Fn+(1-6 keys located on the top row only) to set each sixth of the board to a specific stationary color (And then locked in by pressing Fn+PgUp again). Because the leds are limited to sections rather than each key, there are clearly restrictions that limit amount of possible animation configurations. For me personally, I was not bothered as I only use the option that pans the rainbow across the board anyways. The last thing to talk about is the palm rest. It is hard plastic with a very nice texture and Redragon logo in the middle. It does add much needed comfort to this board as I found it sits higher up than most of my other boards. It is very to remove as well. The palm rest is magnetic (look at pictures). There is nothing special you need to do to attach or remove it. Just line up the rests magnets with the boards metal tabs and it hook right on and won't pop off on it's own. Removing it is as simple as just pulling it off. Overall, I think this keyboard is perfect for those who enjoy a mechanical feel, but either don't enjoy the sounds of a mechanical board (or have family that don't like hearing it). This board provides excellent performance and responsiveness that I always happy to see from Redragon.

Redragon K512 Shiva RGB Backlit Membrane Gaming Keyboard with Multimedia Keys, Quiet Mechanical Feeling Keyboard, 6 Extra On-Board Macro Keys, Dedicated Media Control, Detachable Wrist Rest






",$39.99 ,Membrane,,Kimpropriety,I Love This Keyboard!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2020","I prefer a membrane keyboard, but after briefly trying a mechanical keyboard, I realized I was more accurate with my keystrokes and could type faster when I was using a mechanical keyboard. So, I tried the Redragon Yama, which I liked well enough but it was too loud. I have migraines and ADHD, so not only is noise from a mechanical keyboard distracting but it can also lead to painful headaches. Sound dampening O-rings made no difference on that keyboard and the switches could not be changed out without soldering. So I returned the Yama and purchased this Shiva, hoping that the faux-mechanical style might be the perfect middle ground for me.

I LOVE this keyboard! It does feel like a bit like a mechanical keyboard in the amount of force required to press the keys and the tactile feedback with the keys popping back up again. But, the keys are also soft or cushy, which people who really enjoy mechanical keyboards may not like. The closest switch I can think of are maybe the Cherry MX Reds. Maybe the silent ones especially? It's not quite as springy or crisp as a Cherry Brown, for sure. You can tell it's a membrane due to the soft actuation, but this is a bonus for me and not a drawback. Maybe one day I will be a pro gamer who wants the clickety clack, but that is not this day.

Sound wise, it's not the quietest keyboard I've ever used, but it is very very close. The sound of typing full speed on this keyboard is similar to quiet rain on a window. It's pleasant rather than distracting to me. With my noise-blocking headset on, I don't hear it at all. No one can hear the keystrokes on Discord. My husband's mechanical keyboard has Cherry Blue switches and everyone on Discord complains about the sound, and the Yama had the equivalent of Cherry Browns and they could hear those, too. No complaints about this keyboard, though.

Some things I wish this keyboard did have: fully conflict-free keys. They're unlikely to ever make a fully conflict free version of this keyboard because if you want that feature, you probably also want mechanical. I'm in the minority. But man, that would make it almost perfect.

And more customizable LEDs would be the only other thing I would ask for. Most of Redragon's products don't have fully customizable LED situations, which doesn't bother me a ton. But the Yama had a light scene that I really liked: when you pressed a key, it would light up a random color. I also like being able to customize only specific keys lighting up, like WASD, the map key, etc. With a fully conflict free keyboard, they could allow that customization and make my day.

Some day I will splurge on a metal-frame keyboard with raised Cherry Red Silent switches, but until then this faux mechanical keyboard is a low cost alternative that I really enjoy.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE

",$39.99 ,Membrane,,George Thompson,An all-around contender!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2019","
  Now in all honesty, I'm a long time mechanical switch lover/user but, this board is changing my mind. The only other gaming membrane keyboard I've used is the industry famous Cougar 500K and, in my opinion, the SHIVA K512 is a real close match. I ordered this SHIVA to use with my gaming laptop because it looked light but well-built. I wasn't wrong!  With or without the detachable wrist rest, the weight and size are great! In fact, so far, the only ""con"" I have with this keyboard is it could be just a little, tiny bit heavier.  I have big fingers/hands and find it easy to move around keyboards when I type, not so with this one. Finger placement and key stroke fit my bigger fingers nicely for typing or gaming.  With the holidays here I haven't had much time for any intense gaming but have been able to get in some Cube World and Dauntless with my son and his friends. No complaints with this keyboard when it comes to gaming and I haven't even customized any keys yet or used the macros.  The over-all layout of the SHIVA may take some getting used to for some users, the ""G"" (macros) keys are down the left side of the keyboard but, if you're like me, you have probably used MANY a keyboard. I have at least 5 other ""gaming"" keyboards around my house that my son and I use and this K512 SHIVA is quickly becoming my favorite go-to board. My son is a die-hard Razer fan and he will actually use this SHIVA when using my laptop!!! This is a NICE looking board with its lighting and key profile! It looks stunning in a dark room! I just received a message that new software is available on Redragon's website for this board. I can't wait to explore what I can do with the lighting once I update my software! All in all, this is a great board for whatever your needs may be and at a price point BELOW $40, you really can't go wrong!

  Keyboard feels solid and has a nice weight.  Lays flat, does not have legs to lift back up.  I like the compact size, yet plenty of space for fat fingers.  Nice contrast between keys and board (black and grey on mine).  The mouse is ok, lays flat and low, slides nicely on plastic skids.  Left & right mouse buttons click quietly, and scroll wheel does its job as well.Having had it only for a few days, tried it on both Win10 and Chrome OS's seem fine.  Don't know how long the batteries will last before needing recharging.  The user manual cautions against using a fast charger on the mouse,  this could be a future problem if you don't know or remember this.  A tiny light blue shows in the crack above the mouse wheel as it's charging.  There is a sliding on/off switch under the mouse and a hole for the dongle when it was shipped.The keyboard has 3 tiny warning lights in the URC of the board.  A light labeled ""Caps"" for indicating CAPSLOCK on, a light labeled ""week"" for indicating the battery is weak (really!) and a partial battery discharge symbol label for indicating the keyboard is recharging.  See attached pic.  Made me smile when I realized why the ""week"" label.The user manual is a sheet of 4 x 8-inch tri-folded paper.

  I was very pleased with this product. I was looking for a smaller, thin keyboard and since I did not want to use a USB hub and my laptop only has 2 USB ports I needed a keyboard and mouse combo. The keyboard is about the same size as my laptop keyboard so I don’t have difficulty typing by touch. It comes with a silicone keyboard cover that fits very nicely over the keys with no slippage when typing. I personally don’t like the feel of the silicone plastic preferring the feel of the plastic keys, but it comes in handy if I am eating or whenever the keyboard is not in use as it prevents dust from getting between the keys. I can’t yet speak of the battery life as I haven’t had to change the battery on the keyboard or mouse yet. It has only been two weeks and I use them both pretty mulch all day. The mouse is quite comfortable and glides easily over a multiple of surfaces unlike my old mouse. They both go into sleep mode but I got into the habit of turning both off at the end of the day. I only use them in my home office while working or in virtual meetings. I still use my laptop and other mouse after hours so I am guessing that the battery life will be extended.

Missing and repeated letters above are not the result of human error. The keyboard electronics are what stick. However, the physical key itself does not exhibit anything unusual. It's just the electronic trigger that gets stuck. Consequently letters do not always respond normally when triggered correctly on the keyboard.

The problem is seriously catastrophic. For example, several times I have written long emails that were entirely erased afterward because the backspace key had stuck. Backspace could not be stopped from erasing the entire email!

To be sure, I checked that a low battery issue was not the cause of the problem. Battery was fully charged. Besides, it could not be the cause because it is pluggedd into power via the USB connector.

  Great set of keyboard and mouse. I've been using this set for couple weeks now without any issues. They are being used on my desktop with windows 10. I have tried OverWatch with this set. I'm quite impressed that it performed well. Maybe not the best but they are ok. I like the 1 USB Receiver feature instead of 2. The mouse scroll can be smoother but not really important when you gaming. I don't use the scroller as much. This set is perfect for my mini PC because of the wireless connection and the limited USB connections i have on my Mini PC. This set fits my budget really well and for that reason, i wanted others to see what it can do. This set is perfect for this price range.

",,FELICON,Gaming,Joseph Malone,It works,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2019","I did not know that the mouse had a receiver under it. I saw it but did not know to remove it.
I contacted the seller and they told me to remove it and put it in the usb of my computer. After doing so my mouse and keyboard were working in 10 seconds, no hassle.

It is mechanical with the clear keys so that they light up. The light I got was the clear light and round typewriter keys. I like it.

The mouse has no noise when clicking. It is so quiet I am not used to it yet. The buttons are solid and not cheap feeling. This is good quality manufacturing.

I can type pretty fast on it. Hitting the backspace key is easier for me since it is twice as long taking up the space where the backslash/vertical key used to be. To make the backspace key the size of two keys they moved the backslash key to the right of the apostrophe key making the enter key indented. Instead of a bloated enter key that looks like a backwards fat ""L"" you have a slimmer backwards ""P"" shape. I like it. With backslash on the home row i think I can code faster.

It is a full size mechanical keyboard with number pad that is, backlit, wireless, rechargable, no batteries, and uses only one usb for both keyboard and mouse. The mouse also has two programmable side buttons.

It is pretty much perfect and has all things I wanted. I also ordered the anker at half the price of this which is fullsize too but is not back lit, nor mechanical and the mouse does not have two programmable buttons on side. I will review the anker when it comes in but at twice the price this keyboard is better and hard to beat.

",,FELICON,Gaming,A. Ulrich,Working Really Well After 3-weeks; Only Minor Concerns,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2019","
  After initially receiving the box, I was a little concerned that it was almost completely in a different language, with minimal, and poorly-translated instructions. However, the set-up and use of the keyboard and mouse was pretty much ""plug-and-play,"" and very intuitive. Both the keyboard and mouse look really sharp, and appear to be made really well. After 3 weeks of use, the battery life of both the keyboard and mouse have been fantastic (I've used them for periods over 12 hours at a time at work, without slowing down or running out of power). I plug them in to charge overnight, and then they are good to go the next day. The only DEFECT I've noticed so far: the CAPS lock indicator light is way too dim, and is impossible to see from a typing position. When you put your eye right up to it you can see a tiny red light turn on/off, but you cannot see the light from a sitting position 14""-18"" away. Honestly I like everything else about the keyboard, so I've been managing without it (it's not that big of a deal to me personally, hence the 5 stars).

  I had my last key board and mouse since 2012.  When my granddaughter spilled milk in it the decision was made for me. My granddaughter picked this out and I must say I do like it very much.  Never thought a keyboard and mouse made so much difference in how my computer runs.  I can't say how it is for gaming, however, my granddaughter says it is 5 stars all the way around.  She loves it. The mouse is quiet and I have yet to figure out what all the buttons on the mouse are for.  The only bad comment I have is not about the product itself, its about the instructions/directions that were included in the box.  Very poorly written and written in such small font size I needed a magnifying glass to read them.  I tried to figure out what all the buttons were on the mouse from  these instructions and that is why I do not know what any of them are for.  Will figure it out thru YouTube eventually.

Unfortunately because itd been so long since id backed up my phone it no longer trusted my computer and i couldnt tap ""trust"" when the option popped up (and siri cant do this for you, nor can voice control afaik) so i had to get this keyboard.
A few tips for using this on an iphone:
1. the left to right arrows function as if they were up and down arrows when in settings, so when you are searching for something (in my case icloud storage settings so i could back up everything to the cloud) i needed to hit left and right arrows to scroll down the setting menu
2. If you want to select/tap/click on something HIT THE UP AND DOWN ARROWS AT THE SAME TIME, this took me forever to figure out lol
3. Also i would recommend enabling full keyboard access just to make it easier, its the first thing i did. just hit the search button on the keyboard (magnifying glass) and type full keyboard access then select it in the suggestions
4. Also if youre having issues selecting certain things to click on (because your screen doesnt work and all you have is this keyboard) turning on voice over helps a lot with this a lot. You can do this through siri or accessibility settings.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Azio Large Print Keyboard - USB Computer Keyboard with 3 Interchangeable Backlight Colors (KB505U)






",$29.99 ,Azio,,G. Olson,"Looked real nice, and worked okay, for 2-3 days!","Reviewed in the United States on January 15, 2018","This puppy is going back..
I read the negative reviews (the only ones that you can trust), but I bought it anyhow because the allure of lighted key caps was so inviting, and my vision is not so good. And it looked great for about 2-3 days. Then I started to get double or triple key-press entries for some keys pressed. Widespread, but not even 50% of the keys.. enough however to render the keyboard unusable. And having cut my electronics teeth at KeyTronics (a high-end keyboard manufacturer).. I know that it is not so hard to make a good keyboard. This is a noisy keyboard, has kind of a long travel for the keys and there is virtually no tactile feedback (except when you bottom out). The feedback is mostly auditory. The LED color selections, and dimming capability are nice, but first and foremost, the keyboard must function as a keyboard. I've come to an obvious conclusion - I would say ""Do Not Buy"". I'll never buy any revision of this, nor any product, from this company again. You only get 1 chance to trick me. This one was your chance. To lure me back is going to require extraordinary improvement. If they read these reviews (the manufacturer), which they should, because Amazon is probably their biggest customer, then they would know how to improve it.
1. Make it work reliably
2. Dedicated Hibernate key (screen blank)
3. Clear key for the calculator
4. Add tactile feedback (this will be tough, requires higher quality switches)
But the concept is fantastic. Why can't they just make this thing work?

My opinion: Avoid

In a last-ditch effort, I pulled all the primary keys off and used a Q-tip and petroleum jelly to lubricate the slots where all the keys are installed.

Azio Large Print Keyboard - USB Computer Keyboard with 3 Interchangeable Backlight Colors (KB505U)






",$29.99 ,Azio,,Art the Science Guy,4 ILLUMINATED KEYBOARDS RATED - This is the easiest to read under any conditions,"Reviewed in the United States on May 11, 2018","My favorite, most used keyboard in my office is my Das 4 Professional Soft Tactile MX Brown Mechanical Keyboard. I mention this so that you could have an idea as to what I look for in a keyboard. Although Das does make an illuminated keyboard, Das Keyboard Prime 13 White LED Backlit, at $129.00 it’s a bit too steep for most of us. I wanted an illuminated keyboard for home use so I could use it at night without disturbing anyone by having to keep the overhead lights on.

I ended up buying 4 keyboards looking for the one that not only had good backlighting but also good typing action making it easy to see at night and easy to type on. I wanted to keep the price to around $50.00 – so here is what I bought: At the end of the review I compare all four keyboards.

Azio – Vision Large Font Keyboard ($29.99)

This keyboard has large font: letters, numbers and symbols making it very easy to read in a darkened room. The lighting is even throughout the entire keyboard, there are no bright or dark areas and you can easily change the color of the keys for the entire keyboard or within the 5 lighting zones. For people with vision impairments, this is your keyboard. It is easy to use, set-up and change colors. The typing action on it is very unsatisfying for me as the keys are larger than standard keys so my fingers are not used to the spacing. Also, the height of the keys is somewhat shallower than standard keys and the resistance when you type is “mushy” at least for me. That said, for visually impaired people who are used to the common $15 to $20 keyboard this will be fine for you and at $30, it is a bargain.

Perixx PX-1100 ($59.99)

The keyboard has serious flaws that significantly interfere with it's stated purpose. It is supposed to be illuminated so that it could be used in a dark room. It specifically states that it has key and letter illumination which it does but here lies the problem - the illumination is very uneven with some keys being very bright and others just an inch or two away being very dim. As an example, the left arrow key on my keyboard was very bright while the right arrow key was barely visible especially since the keys next to it were so bright! Another factor is the brightness surrounding the keys which in some areas is brighter than the keys themselves which makes it more difficult to read them. This keyboard apparently has ""zone illumination"" meaning that it has just a few LED's lighting up the keys and in some places, near the edge of the zones, there are dim areas - very dim areas, even with the brightness at maximum. If you're buying this for the illumination to make it easier to read in a dark room, look elsewhere. If you want a cool looking, colorful keyboard that has relatively good good typing action this is your keyboard, it is heavy, well built, has good typing action and poor lighting. This was the first one I bought and I was very disappointed with it, hence the mediocre rating.

Logitech K740 – Fullsize Illuminated Slim Keyboard ($59.99)

This keyboard is very slim in fact, the travel of the keys when you type is minimal and they are very shallow which I am not used to, so I found typing on it unsatisfying. The keyboard reminds me of the one on my inexpensive, compact laptop which gets the job done when I’m traveling but is not designed for serious typing. The illumination however is excellent, bright white and very legible. Set-up is simple and adjusting the brightness is straight forward. If my “go-to” keyboard wasn’t so good, I probably wouldn’t have an issue with this one. Once you have typed on a quality keyboard with mechanical switches you get spoiled! At $60 on sale, I was underwhelmed.

Corsair K55 Gaming Keyboard ($47.99)
This keyboard basically met my expectations for typing feedback and illumination for the price but it’s far from perfect. When you first connect it to your computer you will be met with an over the top moving display of colors flowing across the entire keyboard which is very distracting and thankfully easily changed with just a few key strokes. You can make it all one color if you wish and choose the color you want or make each zone a different color. The keyboard is light weight like most cheap keyboards, lighter even than the non-illuminated Dell keyboard that it replaced but it gets the job done. The first thing I noticed is that the illumination is crisp and even throughout the keyboard. The letters and symbols are centered on the keys and a bit bolder in font than average keyboards. The keys are not individually illuminated but there are enough LED’s to give it an even appearance. The lighting around the keys is somewhat bright but not to the point of making them difficult to read as on the Perixx. Although the keys themselves are not mechanical, they feel somewhat mechanical giving it a nice tactile experience. The keys have the same height as one would find on a good standard keyboard and have about the same travel as well, so it is a good keyboard to type on or use for gaming or both!

There are many illuminated keyboards out there and I spent hours shopping on Amazon and reading reviews trying to finds one that would be right for me. For some people, the typing action may be secondary and so for them, the best buy would be the Azio Vision Large Font Keyboard which at $29.99 is a bargain. It is the easiest by far to read under any conditions and very easy to use/set-up. The Logitech at $60 is also very easy to read but it is twice the price of the Azio. That said, the keys are standard size and it is very well made. For me, the Corsair K55 was the best compromise; although the Azio and the Logitech are easier to read, the Corsair is also easy to read, they are just a bit better in visibility but when I considered typing feel and speed , the Corsair wins.

I hope this helps some of you make the right buying decision.

Lighting is bright if turned up all the way. I like that DPI on the mouse can be changed on the fly without software...high for quick shooters and dropped to low if trying to be the sniper in a game.This could also be used as a second keyboard that additional software on your computer controls to just be macros for something like photoshop, CAD work, or programming.

iClever BK05 Bluetooth Keyboard with 3-Color Backlight, Bluetooth 5.1 Multi-Device Foldable Keyboard with Aluminum Alloy Base for iOS Windows Android Tablets, Smartphones, Laptops, PC and More






",$48.99 ,IClever,,Cat from Belmont,"This is the folding full-sized keyboard I've been looking for. (This is Model BK-05, the larger of two trifold keyboard models.)","Reviewed in the United States on January 13, 2017","
  I always have my iPad with me, but it's a pain to have to also have to pack an Apple keyboard for when I want to take meeting notes or work on documents away from home.  This keyboard is lightweight, folds to a small size, and it is a full-sized keyboard with a useful row of function keys and a great feel for a touch typist.  There is the option to backlight it at two light levels, three colors, for low-light situations.  There is even a sweet drawstring travel pouch.  This thing is small enough that there is no hesitation to throwing it into my bag even if I am not sure I will need it.  I love my Apple Bluetooth keyboard, but this is the one I reach for now if I am heading out.  My iPad has a case that can serve as a landscape-oriented easel, so all I have to do is set it up, unfold the keyboard (that turns it on, no buttons necessary), and start typing.  There is no hesitation or Bluetooth pairing glitching or delays at all.  Also, very important for a rapid touch typist, the feel of typing on this keyboard is great.  I can go at great speed with no errors or sticking.  The top function keys include handy ones like copy, cut, paste, select all, search, and others, a bonus.  The keyboard can be used wirelessly or connected through a standard USB cable, and I have had no issues with having the charge run out while I am out using the keyboard wirelessly.  If I ever do, I'll just plug an external battery into the USB port.Highly recommended.UPDATE FOR CLARITY:  It is now late April and the keyboard -- actually 2 of them because I got one for my husband too -- has continued to be great.  I am adding this update because there is some confusion as to which model is being praised here.  There are actually TWO trifolding keyboard models offered by the manufacturer, and their Amazon descriptions are sometimes easy to confuse.  I have tried them both, and I want readers to know that it is the LARGER trifold keyboardl, BK-05, that I am recommending.  The smaller model, BK-03, is inferior in many ways:  less stable, detectable lag, much harder to type many characters (it has fewer rows of keys), and not backlit.  The somewhat larger size and higher price are worth it:  I recommend going for the larger model, the backlit one, BK-05.  (Though for some reason I have not seen that model number in the description, only on the manual that came with the keyboard.). I will attach comparison photos of the two models.  I am recommending the one on top, the BK-05.

1. Portability: When folded, it takes space barely larger then my Samsung Note 4. I can just toss it in the backpack until needed. Plus it hold charge very long time (easily two-three months).
2. Duo connection: It can be connected via Bluetooth or USB like any wired keyboard. So I can quickly use it to type a quick e-mail on my phone/tablet or connect to any computer when needed.
3. Full keyboard: There is no compromise in size or function keys. There was almost no learning curve using this thing. As other reviewers mentioned, this is probably the best portable keyboard I've used.
4. Backlit: Although gimmicky, changeable back-lit colors up the ""cool"" factors for this keyboard.
If I have to nitpick, the only two improvement I would want are built in phone/tablet holder and way to keep the keyboard locked when folded.
Overall, I highly recommend it.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$48.99 ,IClever,,Kathleen Wooten,"Hisgadget tricolor keyboard review, very positive!","Reviewed in the United States on October 26, 2016","This is a solid product. I got mine in july of 2016 and I have been very pleased. It is extremely flexible. I have used it with my IPad, my Win7 machine and my Ubuntu machine.

The keyboard is extremely compact and portable when folded up. Unfolded it is very comfortable to use with good tactile feedback. I use it for note taking and capturing thoughts on my commute. It makes my IPad a much more useful tool in that respect.

In early October my first keyboard suffered a stroke. The keys on the right side of the keyboard fold stopped working. Seemed like a loose cable on that side since I could close the right side about halfway and the keys started working again. I could not find a way to open the keyboard and reseat the cable.

I sent a note to Hisgadget asking if there was a way to open the keyboard so I could reseat the cable. They were great! They said 'don't try to open the keyboard, just send it back to us and we will send you a new one'. They sent me a return label, I packed the keyboard up and sent it back and I had a new keyboard in a week. We traded several e-mails, they were always very courteous and concerned about my experience.

This is my first five star review. First because the product does exactly what I needed it to do, second because the approach Hisgadget takes to customer service is outstanding.

I am very pleased with this product and vendor.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  5 Stars all around! This keyboard is perfect for an on the go person like myself. I have a tablet that I use when I am out on the road and this does wonders. I thought the hinges would dig into my wrists, you don't even feel them. Not to mention the awesome LED lighting under the keys (I am a sucker for green lights on a keyboard). The typing itself is a very satisfying experience. The travel distance on the keys is great and feel like a full size laptop, there are little stand you can flip out on the sides to raise it up so you are not typing flat. They really have covered all their bases here. They also include a manual to show you all the little shortcuts you can do along the way and which ones work with what operating system. Like I said, 5 stars all around. I will definitely be buying from them again.

",$19.99 ,,,1blind1,It works until it doesn't!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","
  Not a bad keyboard all-around but after using it for a couple of weeks many of the keys stick and so hitting them twice is necessary until you re-read it then find the sticking key has two-four extra letters because the key didn't register the letter the first time. I love the key height. I love the weight of the keyboard as a whole. The keys have a great pressure - You have to hit the keys deliberately and I like that. Wish it was more reliable when striking a key as it takes extra time trying to get what I want on the screen correctly. I am not a mouse user so having a complete keyboard is mandatory for me. Due to it being a limited keyboard the ""windows key"" for instance on each side of the space bar doesn't  work on the right side. Only the left one does making it harder for me to use, consistently and so slows down my keying time tremendously. I'm getting something else to replace this one but will keep this one as a backup when the new one goes down! I truly wish it was better as it would easily be the keyboard I'd use all the time! I do go through keyboards pretty fast - about 1 or 2 a year due to constant use and used several hours everyday of the week Sun-Sun!!

",$19.99 ,,,,A very nice keyboard...,"Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2020","If you're like me, you probably get a bit tired of perpetually feeding your wireless keyboard ""new batteries"" all the time! That's what motivated me to finally start using a USB, wired keyboard again. (Hey, no more pesky, ""feed me more batteries"" messages on my screen... Yay!)

Anyways, here's what I like about this keyboard:

- It's a well-made keyboard. The keys don't cause ""pain"" in my hands or joints, as they are soft to the touch.
- The keyboard has a soft, sandy-like texture applied to them, so you fingers don't slip or slide on the keys.
- They provide the traditional, index finger ""bumps"", so your hands can easily find the ""F"" and ""J"" keys.
- It comes with a numeric keypad. (I used to think the numeric keypad was a waste of space -- until I made the mistake of buying a keyboard that didn't include it. Uh, yeah, I won't make that mistake again...)
- It uses a traditional USB 3 port (not the USB type-c edition).

What you might want to know:
- The keyboard isn't as quiet (or silent) as some of them out there. It's not bad, but you'll definitely hear the clicking of the keys as you press them.
- The keyboard doesn't come with feet to elevate the angle of the keyboard. The angle is preset.

",$19.99 ,,,,Hits The Sweet Spot For The Average User,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2020","First, let me put this review in context. As an old retired guy I'm playing around on the computer for hours a day - gaming, streaming videos, reading the news, and keeping in touch with folks via social media. Let me also add that I am too old and slow to be a hard core, competitive gamer. So even though I can spend long hours in an online MMORPG, I'm actually a casual gamer. And here's a bit more context - over the last few months I've tried a variety of keyboards from high end gaming gear with high end prices to low end cheap stuff so flimsy it feels like it could fall apart even as you take it out of the box. In that keyboard spectrum, this one is not too hot, not too cold, it's just right.

The most expensive gaming keyboard came with all kinds of bells and whistles, from programmable flashing lights to programmable keys for running macros. Unfortunately the software needed to run that keyboard locked up so badly after three days of use, that I couldn't get it unfrozen, making all those expensive extras totally useless. The cheapest low end keyboard stuttered with a noticeable lag bad enough to get any gamer killed in a boss fight. This keyboard is just right for my use. It has a solid, durable feel that does not at all feel cheap or flimsy. There is a muted sound when hitting the keys, enough to let you know that you really are typing but not enough to be distracting. It also stays in place while typing with no slipping or sliding. The cord is long enough that the keyboard doesn't feel tethered on a short leash. It really is plug and play, with no extra software needed to run the thing. And there is no stuttering or discernible lag at all.

The Amazon Basics brand seems to be developing a solid line of products, from clothing to computer gear, that is well made, durable, and affordably priced. This keyboard fits well in the Amazon Basics family and I very much give it 5 stars.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  This keyboard is as simple as they come. Small, basic, not back lit, no bells and whistles but I am typing on it and it is fine. The keys are raised making typing easier and there is a separate number section which I never use but I know some people do. All the F keys are there and a few do things like skip or go back to songs or maybe even video. I haven't used them. There are volume keys which I like and a Windows key. It's fine. It isn't the keyboard I plan to use for good. I want to get a bigger, back lit one. My last one decided to die on me and I didn't want to pay a lot for a keyboard during the holiday season when I was spending so much on gifts.I will use this one until I get around to buying a better one. I don't know what this one sells for as it is not in stock right now but if it is under $30.00, it's worth it if you just want a basic keyboard with the windows button and a few basic functions.

",$29.99 ,Jelly Comb,,JoelW,Great keyboard - my favorite so far,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020","I am very surprised by the quality of this keyboard. It is made of plastic, but is very strong and well constructed. I've used five keyboards over the past year and so far this one is my favorite for several reasons.
1) As mentioned above, it is very well built and even though it's entirely plastic construction it doesn't have the 'flex' or 'give' that most plastic keyboards have. It feels solid and stays still on my desk while I type away on the keyboard.
2) The feel of the keys is great. It feels like a quality mechanical keyboard without the long keystroke distance. it's very comfortable to type on. The keyboard is not a silent keyboard and therefore you should expect to hear the key-click sound, but it is slightly quieter than a typical mechanical keyboard. Also, it's worth mentioning that the key layout is one of the best I've seen for a standard keyboard. Little things like the backspace key just above the enter key on the number pad and the spacing is incredibly easy to type with.
3) The profile (thickness, width, and length) is a great size. It's smaller than most full-sized keyboards, but doesn't cramp the keys too close together; the key spacing is perfect. With most full-sized keyboards, I find myself constantly moving them around my desk because they get in the way. Not with this one.
4) Very responsive (no delay on the key strokes).

The included mouse is definitely on the smaller side, but is a good mouse. I find it a little to small for my hand (I have average size hands), but from what I used of it I could tell it was a solid mouse. The scroll wheel was very responsive and the button clicks felt good. It's also nice that you only need the one dongle to use both the keyboard and the mouse.

In Summary, I would highly recommend this keyboard if you are looking for a full-sized keyboard with a great, quality feel to it, and it doesn't take too much space on your desk. I personally love it and see myself using this one for a very long time.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

",$29.99 ,Jelly Comb,,G,Nice set... a few things to be aware of...,"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020","
  First off, I LOVE the profile of this mouse and keyboard.  Very low profile.  My keyboard tray sits very tightly under my desk and this set has no problem sliding underneath.  The mouse is virtually flat, so I don't feel like I have to hold my wrist at a weird angle to use it.  The keyboard comes with a very nice silicone cover that allows for a more tactile experience when using the keyboard (also keeps it clean of debris).  Very very nice.The only thing I would say is a consideration...  if you walk away from the computer long enough for the mouse to go ""to sleep"", you have to press one of the mouse's buttons to wake it up.  You can't simply move the mouse, you actually have to click.  That scares me, as I'm not sure where the pointer is and I don't really want to click random things.  So far, it hasn't caused an issue, and I feel that the click only serves to wake the mouse... and the mouse doesn't send that command to the PC.All-in-all, a very good alternative to the higher-priced Logitech and Microsoft options out there.  Definitely worth a try.

RK ROYAL KLUDGE Sink87G Wireless TKL Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, No Numpad Compact 2.4G RGB Wireless Keyboard with Tactile Brown Switches, Diversified RGB and Exceptional Macro Settings






",$54.99 ,,,Samuel P.,"Works out of the box, solid build quality and definitely mechanical! (5 months later, bad battery)","Reviewed in the United States on November 23, 2018","With my first keyboard being one of the ancient IBM mechanical keyboards that were handed down to me as a kid, this definitely has a similar feel and sound as I type this.

I order this with the brown switches.

If you're expecting this to be used for portability, it is technically small enough to lug around. However any mechanical keyboard you buy is going to be heavy! This keyboard is no exception and it probably isn't something you want to take to use in public places like Starbucks. That sound of CLACK CLACK CLACK CLACK as you type will most definitely annoy the people sitting around you!

So far I've used this keyboard for 4 hours on the charge that it had out of the box and my first impressions of using this keyboard are just filled with childhood nostalgia! The keyboard is very responsive. Even after switching from a drastically different keyboard, I'm still pounding out between 60 - 70 words per minute casually without seeing any slow down.

The layout feels a bit more compact from the prior keyboard I was rocking for the past 3 months, this makes key travel the only learning curve that I've been fighting for the past few hours, but it's a standard layout without much deviation. So switching to this keyboard, it should become comfortable to begin using within 30 minute or so.

I really like that it has the arrow keys and system keys for insert, delete, home, page up/down, print screen, scroll lock, and so on. This makes the key still useful for working in DevOps doing System Administration tasks in Linux and programming. It's a fair compromise for keeping it portable while maintaining as much functionality as possible.

The lights... they have a reasonable amount of mode selections. I believe there are many people that will appreciate this, however I don't care for back lighting. To me it doesn't really serve a purpose, but if the RGB lights matter to you, you'll probably like the built-in modes available. Considering that, I don't know how moddable the RGB lights are.

Action keys - those keys you have to hold the FN key to use. I primarily use the volume keys and having them available on this keyboard is great. Now... I feel these volume keys are in the wrong order, but having them at all is better than not.

There is also a key to open up ""My Computer"" and the ""Calulator"" app which is extremely useful to me. They also crammed the context menu key into the board, which is something I use regularly.

--------------------------------------
To sum everything up (TLDR):

My initial first experiences with this keyboard are extremely positive. They managed to make a reasonably ""portable"" mechanical keyboard that retains tons of functionality I need for daily tasks.

I will be following up at a later date to update this with further thoughts on battery life and any issues I come across.

--------------------------------------
Update (1 week later) - Battery Life: I've found it very hard to pinpoint what the battery life is for this keyboard as ""new"". After using it as my primary driver for the last week, it's taken a couple of days for me to really discharge it to death. Pretty much amounts of time I don't want to track. When the battery was dead, I was super happy to find out that this keyboard supports input over the USB-C cable that came with it! This means that if the battery ever gets to an unchargeable state (which will happen some day), you can still use this keyboard while wired.

--------------------------------------
Update (5 months later) - Knocking this down to 3 stars. As of now I've had this keyboard for over 5 months and I've stopped using this as a daily driver after running into a two pronged problem.

As of about 2 months ago, the battery failed to hold a charge for longer than an hour of continuous use. Prior it would hold a charge for significantly longer. There's no reason for a LiON battery's ability to hold a charge to dwindle like I experienced. However that would have been fine had I not ran into a 2nd problem.

About a month ago I've found that the keyboard would not work upon a reboot of my PC. I was using it hardwired with the USB cable that came with the keyboard. This shouldn't be a thing. After some troubleshooting, I've determined that it was only having this problem when the keyboard's battery was completely dead upon PC boot.

With the main selling point of this keyboard being that it is wireless, having the core component of it (the battery) going significantly bad in less than a year is a big problem.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

RK ROYAL KLUDGE Sink87G Wireless TKL Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, No Numpad Compact 2.4G RGB Wireless Keyboard with Tactile Brown Switches, Diversified RGB and Exceptional Macro Settings






",$54.99 ,,,S. Church,Great mech for the price,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2019","
  Update: After almost a full year the keyboard is still performing like new for me.  I've only needed to plug it in to charge maybe once a month, all the keys are perfectly responsive, all colors illuminate on all keys, and I can find nothing to complain about.  Indeed, I'm not sure whether it's because I've acclimated to the feel of this keyboard or because the switches are getting broken in, but I find typing on this keyboard effortless and highly enjoyable.  I suspect the people complaining about bad battery life are overcharging.  I never leave mine plugged longer than overnight.Original review: This keyboard's Outemu Brown switches produce a more obvious tactile bump than the Cherry MX Browns on my Das Keyboard at work, and so require slightly more pressure to activate.  That's not to say these aren't still light touch keys, though.  I can still type on them at a normal speaking tempo without bottoming out on my keystrokes.  They require noticeably less force to actuate than my wife's Cherry MX Speed Silvers on her Corsair K70.  At the moment, these Outemus make the tactile bump in the Cherry MX Browns at work feel almost accidental by comparison (which I've always experienced as more of a vague scrape than a tactile bump anyway).  We'll see whether that's still true after a couple months' break-in. (Edit: After 3 months, the tactile bump is still significantly more pronounced on the Outemu Browns than on Cherry MX Browns.  Edit 2: After 7 months, the tactile bump is still plainly present, although it never draws my attention unless I'm actively considering it.)The lighting effects in this keyboard are trippy. You can cycle through lighting modes and record macros using key combinations, but the software downloadable from the rkgaming website makes customizing easier. When you go to download the software, DO NOT use Google Translate, and do not click the English flag. The file host's download link will not appear on Google's translation.  Just Ctrl+F and search for 键盘驱动 on the rkgaming home page, then find Sink87G on the resulting page.  That takes you where you need to be.This keyboard seems well-assembled. There are no dead LEDs, none of the stabilizers seem misaligned, and all of the keys are responsive. Using the ripple lighting effect, battery capacity is plenty.  I've had this keyboard on a single charge for about a month so far with usually around 1 - 4 hours per day of use. I had to send my first keyboard back as defective, but Amazon's generous return policy and Prime shipping ensured I eventually got a working keyboard.  Just bear in mind at this price, you might have to play a bit of quality control.  Just be patient, and you'll end up with a nice mech keyboard for 1/3 or 1/4 the cost of more boutique keyboards at similar quality.Pictured is the RK Sink87G with the

  i was afraid to pull the trigger on this purchase bc it was half the price of the name brands such as corsair and logitech. these mk seem to be the trend these days with gamers. my experience 1mos into usage from using this rk brown, based off my old ibm mk and my son's corsair strafe cherry red, is that the tactile feel is just as good, although the strafe feels a bit more responsive compared to the rk wired mode. the clickity buttons feel solid and doesn't sound loud-loud, as is the overall solid feel of the kbd body material itself. wired versus wireless definitely makes a difference in responsiveness when played with general gaming such as borderlands, hitman, and bioshock on the nvidia shield. battery life under wireless reasonably expected, 1.5wks for few hrs gaming each evening before recharge. kbd works fine with the included 2.5ghz dongle for win10, android and the nvidia. the plus is that the rgb lights up attractively, which is a feature not typically found for wired+wireless kbd in the low-end price range. the only things that knocked off 1 star for this kbd was that wireless distance from the tv to my couch is about 10ft, and annoyingly have lags and long key presses (e.g., theeee doooog) so i need to move closer to about 8ft, and the microscopic printed manual is almost useless for these old eyes.

Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Blue Switch Mini 87 Keys RGB Backlit Keyboard,Programmable 6400DPI Ultra-Light Honeycomb Coal Game Mouse,Gaming Mouse pad for Gamers and Typists






",,,,Mr. Sunny,This is a great value for money gaming accessory package,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2020","This is a great value for money gaming accessory package (Mechanical Gaming keyboard + Mouse + Mouse Pad); as all the needed accessories (be it for gaming or work) are sold as one nice little package without having to buy them separate. The package comes in a little brown box with all things neatly packed inside. Love the multiple RGB color patterns 😊

Keyboard:
I love mechanical keyboards as they let me do the office work super-fast especially typing long emails or lengthy documentation work; and the clicky sound and faster response of the keyboard switches is so much satisfying.

PROS:
1) This is a mechanical keyboard and the keys are clicky, fast and responsive without any hesitation or play in them.
2) This is an 84-key keyboard without the number pad. The size of the keyboard is 14” X 5” inches which is a compact size.
3) RGB colors are nice and have different patterns. There are 6 different color patterns in them.
4) Plug-n-Play and works right of the box without need for any additional drivers or software.
5) Bottom of the keyboard has rubber pads for stability; there are foldable legs at the bottom if one likes to raise it by an inch or so

CONS:
1) The keyboard cord is not braided but is pretty lengthy.
2) The documentation mentioned that the keyboard colors are software controllable but the documentation has no reference of this software. This is not a real issue for me as I personally do not intend to install any extra software into my machine 😉

Mouse:

PROS:
1)Mouse has a trendy honey comb design which looks very cool.
2) Mouse cord is braided; which means no tangles and durable.
3) There are 6 DPI settings depending upon the speed of the cursor one likes. I personally prefer the fastest setting for gaming and the middle one for the office work but there are more than enough to choose from by just pressing the little button on the top below the mouse wheel.
4) RGB colors are nice and there are 6 different patterns to choose from including a NO RGB option. These settings can be interchanged by pressing the tiny little button on the bottom of the mouse next to the optical sensor.

CONS:
None.

Mouse Pad:
PROS:
Love the big mouse pad as there is so much space to move around; and I never thought the big mouse pad is such a big plus.
Underneath rubber padding helps keep it in place.
The edges of the mouse pad are stitched which protects it from fraying over the period of time and eventual separation from the rubber under pad.

CONS:
None

Overall, highly recommend this to anyone for it's great value for money and the usability factor.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",,,,diwu1989,"Awesome set of keyboard + mouse + mouse pad, works great with Mac","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2020","My desk is fairly small, so I wanted to use a ten-keyless compact keyboard.
This set comes with a very nice backlit true mechanical keyboard, with a pretty decent gaming mouse (I run mine on medium sensitivity because I mainly use it for coding vs gaming), and the included mousepad is decently large as well.

The Pros:
- Keyboard and keycaps feel pretty hefty, high quality, much nicer than other keyboards in this price range
- Backlit is super useful at night when I turn off the office light and just focus on coding
- Mouse color is adjustable, useful for when I'm coding at night with room light off
- Included mouse pad is worth 10 dollars on its own already, so the economics of this combo is a no-brainer for me
- Works perfectly fine with my Macbook Pro, and also compatible with Windows 10 of course.
- Keyboard back plate is flush and leveled, I've seen other cheaper keyboard where it's not 100% level on the backboard.

The Con:
- Key switches are screechy initially, I took some keycaps off, and used mineral oil to lightly grease up the squeeky switches
- Left control + windows key + alt + left arrow combo does not register, weird thing is this combo with other arrow keys register, other 4-key combos register fine.

For the price, this combo is great value and awesome for home office productivity.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

  I needed a compact keyboard for when I am on the road.  I do have a lightweight wireless keyboard, but I just don't like typing on it.  I've been used to using a mechanical KB for my desktop set up (Logitech G810) and I just really can't stand typing on anything other than a mechanical KB.I saw this package for a compact mechanical KB and gaming mouse (with RGB to boot!) at a reasonable price, and thought i'd give it a shot.  The KB is actually a joy type in.  It feels a bit like Cherry Blue's.  The travel is pretty good with a satisfying tactile feel.  I tried to game with it briefly, and it was fine, no ghosting or anything.  The RGB is nice addition, and it has a few functions, but nothing special.  Not a fan on the font on the key caps, but, it's all good, i'll probably end up wearing them out.The mouse is nice, it has braided cable, RGB, and a DPI switch.  It's also find for gaming, but I mainly play with a controller, so it felt fine for me.  Mouse pad is a nice addition.Overall a great value package.

",,,,Chris,Good newbie setup,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020"," First and foremost, make sure you look at the pictures if you order the blue. The mouse and keyboard are not the same colors. I got these as a gift for my wife and she was ok with that. If you aren't then get a different color set and just use custom keycaps.

This is a great setup if you are just getting into gaming and want to try a mechanical keyboard without braking the bank. They are using bsun box blue switches, which are fairly loud clicky switches. If you play online games I recommend fine tuning your mic to try and not catch the noise or your team may hate you by the end of the night. But, if you are like myself and like to hear each click then these are great.

The mouse is similar, a good starter mouse. I do recommend replacing the feet on them with some 3rd party smoother ones if you want a smoother glide, but the stock ones aren't bad.

Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo, UHURU 2.4G USB Wireless Keyboard Mouse for Laptop, Computer, PC, Tablet, Desktop,Mac, Windows XP/7/8/10, Long Battery Life(Battery Included)






",$26.99 ,Uhuru,Gaming,Manju Ananth,Very good value and highly functional keyboard/Mouse commbo.,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2018","I like to get the hit sound when I type. I am used to that. I dont like those quiet keyboards, you dont know the key you pressed did really make it or not. My work typing intensive and I need to do it fast. At the same time, if the keys are too tight, I have to hit hard to get that sound and it strains my hand. I have tried those wired keyboards from DELL and HP. All of them are not up to the mark. Even expensive Logitech is too soft. After much research, I found this one. This does the job very well. Here is my summary of what is good about this:
1. If you hit little hard like me, it makes the sound (not loud, just appropriate click). If you are a soft typer, it doesnt make sound.
2. Keys are not too tight. So it doesnt strain your hands.
3. Mouse shape and ergonomics just good for me. Too big or too small - both are bad. I would say medium sized hands, this is well made for it. You dont want round shaped or really wierd shaped ones. Both are unusable after sometime.
4. Comes with batteries, and little USB stick as usual. Just plug and play. This is not new. Every manufacturer does it.
5. Very attractive pricing for Keayboard+Mouse combo. I have bought several (4-5) so far. The paid from $22-$28. The one that comes with mouse pad, is actually cheaper $22, but not happy with keyboard even though they all look same.
6. No problems with connectivity so far. Key strokes do appear on computer perfectly. No missing strokes.
7. Attractive White Colored ones that look like Apple. The white one with gray accent it looks so good.
8. Not draining my batteries at all. I think it has smart energy management.
9. Works perfectly with MAC and Windows. Nothing special needed. Just plug and play and it works between platforms.

What could have been better:

Lighted keys. It makes it so easy in low light conditions. May be next model.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

  Nice keyboard. solid feeling keys with positive responses. Full size keys In a compact frame that has indicator lights for the CAPs and Num's locks. The mouse is ergonomic and has a 'power-down' (after 7 min idle time) that takes a little getting used to. You need to 'left or right click' to wake it up. Good power saving feature and it is quick to respond. I have had no issues with connectivity or miss-keying. I'm using the keyboard/mouse combo about 6' (not line of sight) from the Nano-receiver with 0 connectivity issues. Initializations were easy to perform and worked as expected.If there could be a negative, the keyboard does not have an on/off switch; so you'll have to keep your animals off the desk/keyboard.I like the overall ""feel' and performance of the components.

  Pretty much perfect for my needs. I’m a college student and this keyboard is really versatile, I can connect it to my desktop computer, ipad, and even my phone! Typing on this keyboard is really nice and I reccommend this to anyone who needs a bluetooth mechanical keyboard that they can take anywhere. However I would like to note that 60 percent keyboards have a learning curve to them, but overall it was easy for me to learn. And I’m a user of both Mac OS and Windows, however in the manual the switch is backwards for some reason, Fn + A is to switch to Mac OS Mode, and Fn + S is to switch for Windows, which is no biggie as long as it works lol. I haven’t used the included mouse because I already have a one, but I can tell it’s high quality as well.  So all in all I can use this keyboard to type essays on my mac, while I can also use it for gaming on my PC, this is the best of both worlds. 5/5 would reccommend.

  Originally, I had bought the Apple $199 Smart Keyboard Folio for my new iPad Pro 12.9"". I quickly found out how cumbersome both keyboard and cover were to use. When folding the cover back, the keyboard would lay unprotected either on the table top or on my lap. Within two weeks, the cap lock key kept getting stuck and could only be released by turning the entire iPad off and restarting it. As I was still struggling with both problems I saw a Youtube video by Tom Solid, the founder of the Paperless Movement, about the KHOMO iPad Pro case and I ordered it immediately. It is a wonderful cover that protects not only the entire iPad but also the Apple Pencil and keeps it from falling off as used to happen with the Apple folio. But by taking off the Apple Smart keyboard Folio I had also lost the external keyboard. Since I am doing quite a bit of typing, I kept looking for another solution. At just about that time, Tom Solid, in another YouTube video, was reviewing  the iClever foldable Bluetoothh keyboard. I ordered it the same day. I was somewhat skeptical but the moment I received it and opened it, I knew it was the answer for me. It paired within seconds and it works flawlessly. Once I am done typing I just fold it up and it is out of the way. And it is so small, it fits easily in a side pocket of a purse or carrying bag. For under $30, this keyboard is an unbelievable buy. I only wish it would come with a sleeve, but perhaps eventually the manufacturers will add that too.I only had one minor question one time since using the keyboard. I sent an email to the manufacturer and they answered back within a very short time. They answered my question extensively and even wrote back one more time to make sure that I was completely satisfied.I am recommending the iClever keyboard to anyone with an iPad. It is so much more convenient that typing on the built-in one, and it functions and works flawlessly.

  This keyboard gets 5 stars from me because it is compact, lightweight, and very convenient to use with my iPhone (typing on an itty-bitty phone keyboard aggravates my carpal tunnel). It didn't take long to get accustomed to the iClever fold-up keyboard. My only suggestion for the manufacturer would be to add a locking mechanism for the keyboard when it is open so the user could type on his/her lap. As it is now, a firm, flat surface is needed; otherwise, the keyboard folds up. This feature might add to the cost, but it would be helpful. Still, I have found this keyboard to be a very good product, deserving of 5 stars (so far).

Arteck 2.4G Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo Ultra Compact Slim Stainless Full Size Keyboard and Ergonomic Mice for Computer/Desktop/PC/Laptop and Windows 10/8/7 Build in Rechargeable Battery






",,,,James W.,"Good build quality, compact size, good battery life. [EDIT: Mouse battery died, was replaced]","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2019","[Original Review]
The first thing I want mention is the incredible build quality of the keyboard. The backing is made of metal. Not ""matte finished to look like metal,"" real metal. As such, I have no worries about breaking it- like can happen to cheap plastic alternatives.

The mouse seems to be made from a lighter weight plastic construction, but I've been using it for a couple months now and it hasn't had any issue.

One concern I had vs. many other wireless keyboards/mice is the lack of a replaceable battery. This has not turned out to be an issue. The keyboard and mouse each take about two hours to charge fully from 0%, and in my initial test, I got three full days of regular use (about 6 hrs / day) before the mouse died. They charge using a standard microusb input.

Lastly, the shape of the mouse is fairly generic, but un-offensive, and is big enough to hold comfortably. I included a picture of it next to a Razer NAGA for comparison.

Overall, 5/5, would recommend.

Unboxing was “frustration free” as advertised. I recycled my Logitech cord that connected to my desktop and inserted the USB receiver in it and it worked.

I plugged in the Micro USB charging cable to the keyboard and mouse. Only one Micro USB charging cable came with the combo so I used an extra Android Micro USB charging cable to charge both at the same time.

I was able to use the keyboard and mouse in a few moments. My computer automatically updated the files needed in a few minutes.

All in all the unboxing and set up was quick and effortless. Now I am going to explore the keyboard.

This keyboard has no number side keyboard that makes it smaller.

It has a blue function key to access page up, page down, home, and end, on the lower right where the left, right, up, down keys are.

Along the top with the F keys are blue function commands:

Escape has “Media” – when pressed opened Wave Pad, a NCH program I have installed.

F1 has an >/||, which did nothing when pressed

F2 has |<<, which did nothing when pressed

F3 has >>|, which did nothing when pressed

F4 has a speaker symbol )x, That mutes sound

F5 has a speaker symbol - which lowers volume

F6 has a speaker symbol + which increases volume

F7 has a symbol for home, which opens a new browser tab

F8 has a symbol of a magnifying glass that opens a search side window and uses Bing for search, when I clicked on one of the search results it opened a new Chrome tab. I had Chrome already opened.

F9 has a symbol for a folder, which did nothing when pressed

F10 has a symbol for power which turned off my computer. Since I had programs opened my computer asked for permission so I canceled.

F11 has “insert” on it which is pretty self explanatory

F 12 has “PrtSc” for print screen

The action on the keyboard is nice and a lot quieter than the Logitech keyboard I am replacing. The mouse action is good and also quiet.

For less than $23 this is a good keyboard and mouse. I never used the number keys on the side of my Logitech keyboard, which needed batteries, as did the mouse that came with it. The mouse had begun to do double clicks when I clicked once and the keyboard “enter” would stay down. That's why I replaced them for this Arteck Keyboard and Mouse combo.

  I have been a Logitech customer for as long as I've owned PCs and this is my first negative review. I bought this combo to use with a Surface in a dock as the Microsoft keyboard is crap. The combo worked great but when I moved the Surface to a second dock I realized I'd have to move the dongle too but because its so small and hard to grasp I realized a second dongle would be best. I bought a Unifying receiver only to find out, after a lot of hassle, that this combo is NOT unifying and I was unable to a replacement receiver on Amazon. Logitech sells a replacement dongle for the mouse but they want $15 PLUS shipping whereas I can buy the mouse and receiver for $13 from Amazon.So, what the hell is going on? Why are there both Unifying and non Unifying products out there and why is the only way to know is after you've bought them is to look for the orange logo on the devices. (The description doesn't mention it at all but the questions segment says yes AND no without Logitech stepping in to correct the misstatement.Logitech needs to seriously clean up this mess.At the very least I suggest they add the letter U to every Unifying product they market.

  I have an old K360 with unifying dongle/keyboard.  I loved my old keyboard and wanted another one.  I bought this product and returned it immediately.  This product is NOT the same.  It is marked as a K360, but there are vast differences.1) The keyboard, mouse, and dongle are not unifying (I just looked and they removed that from the description).  What this means is that you can't pair any Logitech dongle with any keyboard/mouse using the logitech app.  So, if you lose the dongle or break it (the one in this product is made poorly) by pulling on it too hard - you are out of luck.  The box packaging even shows that it is a unifying keyboard/mouse/dongle - BUT IT IS NOT!2) The on/off switch is terrible.  Once it is on, leave it alone - don't even touch the switch or you might turn it off.  It is poorly constructed and mounted.  Good luck in telling if the keyboard is on/off.  Even the Red/Green coloring underneath the switch is missing (old K360 had this).3) It does not have the K360 gloss finish.  I did not care about this, but it is disturbing that the same part number is not made the same.  It made me wonder if this a counterfeit product.  Even the packaging was generic and the instruction booklet was photocopied.  Not what I would expect from a premium priced product.4) The mouse was really light and cheaply made.  Buy it separately - but you can't unless you take 2 USB slots for the dongles - one for the keyboard and another for the mouse.  [Back to the unifying dongle issue.]Just look for something else - you will be happier.

",$35.99 ,Logitech,,topgum,Tilt legs break easily,"Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2019","
  The keyboard itself works well, with a good and stable connection to the PC. However, within the first week, both of the tilt legs fractured with normal use. Logitech technical support was difficult to deal with, in order to obtain new tilt legs. If you purchase this product, be careful when elevating the keyboard using the tilt legs.

  I bought this keyboard for a work-from-home setup where my monitors take up the vast majority of the desk space.  The nature of my job means that I NEED to have the numberpad on my keyboard, which ruled out most other compact keyboards.  Some of the buttons, particularly the Home and Page Up and Down keys, are not where my fingers expect them to be, but the letters and numbers are right, and that's what matters.

  Printing greeting cards mostly.  This keyboard is the very same one that I am throwing out.  The switch, according to a computer expert, is not very good,  It's best to leave it on because if you play with it it does not work all the time.That is why I have decided to buy a different one.

  I love love love this keyboard. The only down side is out of the 2 that I have owned one I had to replace the rechargeable cell and the other was not repairable. I have added a 3 unit for my wife's laptop and she would also recommend this keyboard as well. The only thing that would make this better... backlit keys with it all. As sometimes I do work in the bat cave and like my mood light dim.

HyperX Alloy Elite 2 – Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Software-Controlled Light & Macro Customization, ABS Pudding Keycaps, Media Controls, RGB LED Backlit. Linear Switch, HyperX Red






",$129.99 ,HyperX,,,"Sturdy, great action, thoughtful design","Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020","This HyperX Alloy Elite 2 – Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is sturdy and weighs a ton. It’s definitely not made to hold in your lap. The keys have a nice action, without the audible click of some Cherry keys but they're not supposed to. The action is not too hard and not too soft, just overall great action.

I like the font of the keycaps – it’s nice and bold – and find it easy to read. The light really shines through to make each letter bright and legible.

The HyperX Ngenuity software to customize the keyboard is labeled “Beta.” Ngenuity allows you to customize the keys a LOT. Since I am so imaginative and flexible, I set all the keys to the same color. You can drag around a color wheel and literally pick any color there is, which is an incredibly thoughtful touch. I say this after having multiple keyboards with colors or color combos that could not be customized and didn’t have any presets that I really liked.

This keyboard has four multimedia keys (RW, FF, Play/Pause, and Mute). There is also a roller wheel for volume. This is another thoughtful touch that I really appreciate; some of my gaming keyboards just don’t have this.

This keyboard has three keyboard control keys. Brightness, Profile, and Gaming. The brightness key lets you select one of 5 brightness levels - off and then 1-4 (just press to select one of the five levels).

The profile key lets you select one of three profiles. Each profile can have different key colors, mappings, effects, and macros. I added the “solid” key effect and set the color to a yellow which showed the best through the top of the keycaps for my eyesight.

The Gaming key disables the Windows key so if you're in a game and accidentally hit the key your window focus does not shift away from your game. I love this feature because this problem invariably hits me in PVP or a boss fight where it can be a BIG deal to leave others floundering while you’re windowed out.

In addition, there is a USB port on the top of the keyboard, For those of us who use a USB (as opposed to wireless) mouse this is great! Of course, you can plug in any USB2 device (wish it were USB 3, but better than nothing.) There is a separate USB cable on the keyboard that drives this port so it's a totally separate USB port from the keyboard. Some of my other keyboards are also made this way, and it’s a feature that I really appreciate.

CONS:
The HyperX Ngenuity software is a little jinky and not totally intuitive, but I figured it out. Hopefully that will be corrected by the time it’s out of beta.

I was disappointed that there is no 'function key' on the keyboard that would let you map any key to a program or function. You also cannot map key combinations like CRTL-Pause. The remapping is only for a single key. And since there's no Function key on the keyboard you can't really map any key except one you never use. This would be potentially good for gaming but I'd like to be able to easily map a key combination to something like “launch Notepad.” Oh well.

Twice now the key lights have changed on me without warning and I’m not sure why. As an example, when I got up this morning the color scheme had changed from Solid to Wave.

Overall this is a really nice keyboard with a lot of thoughtful design touches. I don’t think I’m a total fan of pudding keycaps, though, as they let so much light in around each key. This keyboard is bright enough to light a room on its own, I think.

HyperX Alloy Elite 2 – Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Software-Controlled Light & Macro Customization, ABS Pudding Keycaps, Media Controls, RGB LED Backlit. Linear Switch, HyperX Red






",$129.99 ,HyperX,,,"Love the lighting and keypress, but no wrist wrest and keycaps are ABS.","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2020","I’ll cut to the chase. There are two things I don’t like about this keyboard:

1) Unlike the Alloy Elite 1, the 2 doesn’t come with a wrist wrest. Nor is there one specifically made for it as the 1 had. Some people might not need a wrist wrest, but I do. Partly due to the height I like my desk at, partly because my smartwatch band rubs the desk surface otherwise, and partly for comfort. I ended up purchasing the standard Wrist Rest that HyperX makes (ASIN: B07GP7JXQY). It’s not custom made for it but does fit the Alloy Elite 2 perfectly (width and height are spot on). It’s comfortable, too. But it does add an extra expense that the Alloy Elite 1 didn’t have.

2) The keycaps are ABS, which are made with low quality plastic. The surface of the keys becomes shiny over time and can develop dents and wear. There is no texture on them either, making them more slippery. For the “Elite” category, I’d have much-preferred PBT keycaps. They are harder, more durable, and have texturing. The keys that come with the Alloy Elite 2 are specially designed to show more lighting, so it limits the options for replacement. I did come across some PBT keycaps made by Havit (ASIN: B07SGF9DTY) that look to match the same design, so will probably be upgrading to them in the future. Again, another added expense.

Now, that’s what I don’t like. Pretty much everything else I can say about this keyboard is good. I found I prefer it over my Razer Huntsman Elite. In fact, since I got the Alloy Elite 2, my Razer Huntsman Elite has been collecting dust. That, too, came with ABS keycaps and I replaced them with PBT. I could put those PBT on the Alloy Elite 2, but they would hamper the lighting. Even though it’s a cosmetic feature, I personally like the lighting. It’s brighter and more vibrant than simply leaking out the bottom and coming thru the characters at the top. I will say that the Razer software has better lighting options and customization (even loads special lighting that synchronizes with certain games). But I was able to get the general look I like using the HyperX NGENUITY software.

I also prefer the keyclicks better on the Alloy Elite 2. They respond just as well as the Razer Huntsman Elite but are quieter. As such they don’t get picked up in my mic as badly when chatting in-game. (Though, it is mechanical, which means there is some noise). The key presses feel softer and less “clicky” if that makes sense.

As far as the HyperX NGENUITY software goes, you’ll notice it’s not rated the best. Compared with Razer Synapse, it’s more barebones. The most annoying part is that it stays open on your taskbar rather than minimizing to the notification area as Synapse does. That said, I got really frustrated with Razer Synapse to the point I’m slowing swapping out my devices to HyperX. It would constantly crash, forget my login, not load profiles correctly, and hijack my keysets even after I closed the game associated with them. While NGENUITY is more limited, it doesn’t give me any of those problems. I’m able to remap keys to specific games, which switch when the game loads and go back to normal when the game closes. Many of the settings save to the keyboard itself rather than a profile I have to log into. Although I do see a benefit to having a login, which I hope HyperX includes at some point. They don’t even have an online account to register your products, making getting support more difficult. As of now, NGENUITY is still in beta, so it's basic, but it works.

The media controls work great and because I use the keyboard for things other than gaming, I like having the numpad. The keyboard is pretty heavy. I weighed it in at 3 pounds 1.7 ounces (with the cord plugged in), which is nearly a pound more than the Razer Huntsman Elite. The combination of the weight and rubber feet keep the keyboard from sliding around during rigorous gaming.

### Conclusion ###

The overall build quality of this keyboard looks and feels great. I love the lighting and the keypresses. I wish it came with a wrist wrest and better-quality keycaps, but I’m fine upgrading those things since the keyboard as a whole is nice. As such, I won’t be taking my Razer Huntsman Elite out of the closet anytime soon.",FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

",$129.99 ,HyperX,,,The Most Disappointing Keyboard in 2020,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2020","
  This is by far one of the worst keyboard and customer service I had in 2020 so far, Very disappointing.Keyboard feels heavy, I guess because of the aluminum alloy chassis with the solid steel frame, but that's maybe the only good thing about it, the moment I connected it, it had a defective RGB lights, only the F1 would light on and that is it, not another single  light will turn on. The rest of the keyboard is dark, I tried their horrible NGenuity software after hours trying to download it from the cancer windows store because they don't have direct link from their website, they just use Microsoft store, and after that I stayed hours trying to get my keyboard discovered on their app and finally It did, then I tried to change colors but still only the F1 would work the rest of the keyboard is just dead, and long story short their customer service is horrible too, I tried to contact them before about a headphones I got that was defective too and they kept bombarding me with questions until they stopped responding.Just Stay Away From HyperX And Go To Logitech, they have better software, peripherals and their quality control is very high plus their customer service is one of the best I've ever experienced, unlike HyperX horrible customer support.
